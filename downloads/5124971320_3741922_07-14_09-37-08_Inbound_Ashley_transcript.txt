 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, I'm trying to inquire on Shredding some paper, statements and all that. What I need to do, what's required? Yeah, there's a couple of different options offered. How many file boxes or files words of Shredding, do you estimate you have? Well, it's a residential. There's quite a bunch of things and all that. Okay, do you know roughly the volume? How many file boxes you could fill or trash bags? No, they're not no file boxes at all. It might be a big bag or whatever. Okay. So with a smaller amount of Shredding, anything less than 90 pounds, as long as you don't need to witness the Shredding, drop off is a great option for you. What is your zip code and I can see with nearby? Seven, eight, seven, five, two. Perfect. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Farmer. Are you on a cell phone here? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What I can do is I'm going to text you a couple of locations that you offer the drop-off services. If you call them directly, they'll be the ones to let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. So I went ahead and sent that over to you. And what is your first name, sir? Sir, I'm Francis. That's why we are in. Thank you, Francis. Let me go ahead and get that information sent to you. I will send you another text. It's just going to be asking how my customer service was today. It's a quick one click, one to five star review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. You have to have a minimum of 90 pounds. So if no, no, no, no. You can take anything less than 90 pounds there. Okay. Thank you. Yes, sir. Thank you. Have a great day.
