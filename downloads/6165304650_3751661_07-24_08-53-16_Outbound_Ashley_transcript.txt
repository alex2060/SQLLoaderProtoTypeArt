 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Can you give me an idea what it costs? I have some old check carbons and some old checks and things that I'd like to have shredded. Can you give me an idea how much it costs to have that done? Sure. How many file boxes or trash bags of shredding would you estimate that you have? Two, not great big trash bags. Two bags about grocery sex size. Okay. So with a small amount, generally your best option is going to be looking into a drop-off location. What's your zip code? And I can see what's nearby. 49519. 49519, you said? Yes. All right. And is this a cell phone that you're on? No. It's just a landline. Okay. What I can do is transfer you then. There's the UPS store of a 44th street that does offer drop-off. I can transfer you there. They'll let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. Okay. All right. Hold on just a moment.
