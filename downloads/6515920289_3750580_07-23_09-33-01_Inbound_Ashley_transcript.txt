 Thank you for calling record nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yeah, Ashley, I am in need of having some pages being scanned and sent via PDF. OK. We do very high volume scanning. You don't need pages you have. One book has maybe 150 pages. OK. And it's just one book that you have or? I have another two or three other ones that I need to have done as well. You know, you're looking specifically for book scanning where those books remain bound or? Right now, they're a hundred copies of printouts. And they're in what's the call? Pocket protectors. OK. What says it put a word located? 84096? 84096. OK. So you think in total you have maybe 400 pages or so is that correct? Sure. Yeah. OK. Maybe 300. OK. Yes. So that wouldn't mean our minimum. But I can try to refer you to some walk-in locations that offer scanning services. And maybe I could do it yourself type thing. I might have another option where they can do it for you. But is this a cell phone? Yes. OK. So I'm going to text you a couple of locations that you offer some scanning. If you want to reach out to them directly, they'll get you some information on this. And then what is your first name? Sarah? With an H. Without. Without. OK. Thank you. So I did send that over to you. I will send you another text that's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. OK. Wonderful. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
