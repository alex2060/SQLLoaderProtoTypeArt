 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yeah, Ashley, I've got some stuff I want to just basically shred up. And I never even looked at this before. So you're the first person I've ever talked to. So please forgive my ignorance. It's not that much. It's old stuff. So I mean, how does it work? It's like basically one box worth. It's not much. So? Yeah, so if it's a smaller amount of shredding and you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off is a great option for you. What's your zip code and I can see what's nearby? My found one. Actually, it's in a little tin Colorado. It's 80123. So I already kind of did that. Okay. That's the UPS store there. So this must have routed back to Shred Nations. But I can transfer you to that UPS store. They'll let you know what they charge and if there's room in there bin. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, one more.
