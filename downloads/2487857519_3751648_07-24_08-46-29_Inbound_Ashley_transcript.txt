 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Do you guys accept sharps for this poll? So we not us directly, but we do list some locations that can accept sharps. What's your zip code? 48336. 48336. 48336. Oh, I'm sorry. You're breaking out a little. Is that what you said? Yeah, 48336. Correct. So you said you occasionally accepted that? I'm confused. I'm at our corporate office. So I'm not where you would take anything, but I can look up who takes sharps in the area. OK. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yeah, I'm on a cell phone. OK, so I can text you a couple of locations that offer some drop-off services. If you want to reach out to us for purple, you'll have to call them directly to check. So they are a separate service in my own. But if you call those locations, they should be able to sell you in. OK, that sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. All right.
