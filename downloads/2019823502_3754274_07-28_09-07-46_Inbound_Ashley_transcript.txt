 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, I just got a call from Martin regarding the scanning services. Okay. So we have office in Brooklyn. I don't know you guys providing services nearby. Yeah, I see a 11378 zip code. Is that where it's located? Yes. I do see information here about 25 engineering drawings is what you're looking at? Yes, do you scan it? You know, and email us. So we can look into some options. But are these all just single-sided engineer drawings? Yes, single-sided, correct. Okay. So our minimum is going to be a little higher than that in the area. So unfortunately that's not something that we can help you with, but I can try to refer you to someone who might be able to help you. So it's 25 in total. It looks like our minimum is about 30. You don't think that you could meet that 30-page minimum. No. Okay. All right. Perfect. So what I'll go ahead, I'm going to email you some partners of ours in the area. You know, you'll have to call around and see if they'll do large formats. If not, they're at least near you and might point you in the right direction. Yeah, I do. I'll send you an email with some information on that for you. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.
