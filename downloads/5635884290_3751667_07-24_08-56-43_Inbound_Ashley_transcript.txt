 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, do you do a lot of shredding? Yeah, we have some different options for shredding. How many boxes are bagged? Do you have? I have three containers, three boxes, I guess you'd say. What do you charge? There is a fee for shredding. With that amount, we would refer you to a drop-off location. Those are UPS stores, mail centers, things like that, and they charge by the pound. What's your zip code? Well, I want to know if there's a place where that don't charge. Unfortunately, I don't know of any free shredding. You can always try to find a shred event. That may be a bank or your city hall, credit unions holding, but yeah, unfortunately there's shredding or fee for all the shredding we have here. Okay, thank you. Thank you.
