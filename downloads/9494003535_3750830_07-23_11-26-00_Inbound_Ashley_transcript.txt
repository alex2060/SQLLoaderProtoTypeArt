Thank you. And it looks like you placed a request online as well. Yeah. You can figure more of that. Perfect. Okay. Well, yeah, we'll go out. But I don't think the email provided was d-e-r-m-m-a-one at Cox.net. Yes. Perfect. All right. And then the 20 boxes that you have. Are these the small 15-inch copy paper boxes or the larger two foot? Yeah. Like a banker's, banker's box size. Yeah. They just come in a couple standard sizes. So there's a small 15-inch box and then a larger two foot in length. Do you know what size you have? Not really. I'm not, I'm even estimating on the 20s. Okay. So we'll just say somewhere around 20 small file boxes you're thinking. So let me just 20.5 something. Yeah. Perfect. All right.
