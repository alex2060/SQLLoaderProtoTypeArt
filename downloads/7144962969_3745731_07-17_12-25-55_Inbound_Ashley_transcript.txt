 Thank you for calling Record Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi. I did a request for information online and I got a couple calls. So I just want to kind of talk through what we want, what we need. What we have. Okay. Sure. My name is Julie Johnson. Okay, Julie. And you're looking for records scanning? No, just storage. I think we have right now. Yeah. What we have right now, let me check the email. I don't know if there's a... Okay. We have 80 boxes and they're at BRC, which is used to be sick. But our company is winding down. And what my boss wants, he wants to be able to prepay for the storage for the four or five years, whatever it is. We have destruction dates on all the boxes, but BRC will not take any prepayment and they will not just destroy the boxes and, you know, with almost date that they are set to destroy. Okay. He would kind of... We're hoping to find something somewhere that could store the boxes and just kind of do it automatically. Okay. Off to be paid upfront. Okay. And you said you have 88 boxes correct? 88 boxes. Most of them... I'm looking at my list right now. I think we have some 88 pieces. Am I using some of them or masks, like a rolled up... Oh, sure. masks for projects. But I would say the vast majority of them are boxes. Okay. And these are like the small 15-inch copy paper boxes or do you all have boxes? Like the... Like the... Like the bankers boxes? Yeah. They just come in a couple of standard sizes. Do you know if you're at a 15-inch or the larger 2-foot ones? No, the 15-inch. So standard ones. Okay. Perfect. And what says the code of where these records are located? It's in Irvine, so it's 9,2,606 right now. 9,2,3,5. Do we think zero is good? Anywhere in... Anywhere in like in Orange County. Okay. Yeah. So we're... I think by Boston more in North Orange County, we had our offices in Irvine, so... Okay. Sure. So, yeah. So I do have some options there in the area, Julie. So let me gather a little information from you. And then I'm going to have the storage providers for the area get you some options. What's the name of the business, your wife?

So what I'll go ahead and do here, I work with four storage providers that do service to Irvine area. So I'm going to have each of them in touch with you directly with some information on this. Okay. What are the nature of these documents? Other business documents. Business, okay, business records for storage. Yeah. Well, I will have each of these storage providers in touch directly.
