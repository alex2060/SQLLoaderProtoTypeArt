 Thank you for calling Medical Waste Proves. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. Are you in the Colorado area or is this a national thing? Well, I'm at our corporate office, but I am in Colorado. I can get you some information on your shredding. Where are you? It's not shredding, actually. It's the medical waste. My daughter left me with needles and things that I'm trying to just find a best place to deposit them. What's your zip code? 80021. All right. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. All right. So what I can do is I can text you a couple locations that do accept some sharp strap-offs. If you want to reach out to those locations directly, they would be the ones that you know what they charge, if there's room in there bin, all of that. So I want to hand send that over to you. And then I will send you another question. Perfect. And I sent you one other text. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. If you get a moment for that as well, that'd be appreciated. Okay. And then one other thing I'm going to ask you. How much is this shredding of private charts and things? On a year. So for papers shredding, how many boxes are bags of shredding do you estimate you have? I will probably have three. Okay. So with a few boxes or so, you can look into a drop-off UPS door. If you call them directly, they'll be the ones that let you know what they charge, and if there's room in there bin. So that would be a good option for a few boxes or so. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. I will look for yours. All right. Thank you. Okay. Uh-huh. Bye-bye.
