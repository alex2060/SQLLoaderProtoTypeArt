 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. That's a Vashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. My name is Michelle Chamberlain, and I actually have submitted a request for help with shredding services, and I got it taken care of. I drafted off at one of your places, and everything's good to go. Although they would not take my electronics, my hard drive, things like that, where do I go to... Yeah, for electronics. What is your zip code, and I can look into some options? It's 899-177. Okay. And is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. So I can text a couple of locations that do take some electronic recycling. You always want to call first and make sure they accept what you have. Okay. So if you call them, they'll get you some info. So I did just text you that info. Okay. Yes, you want to try them. All right. Now, second question real quick. I don't know anything about computers. I don't even know where my hard drive is. So I don't have one of the tower things. I think it's in the actual monitor part. Will they be able to help me with that? They should be able to help you with that. Yeah, at least get you some direction. Some of them take the whole computer and all of that, so yeah, they'll let you know what they accept. Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much for your help. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Bye.
