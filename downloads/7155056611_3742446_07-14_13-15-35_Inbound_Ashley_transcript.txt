 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, I was trying to contact medical waste for the same company. Yeah, that is another division of YEP Shred Nations. I can help you with that. You have some medical waste services that you're looking into. Well, so I actually work for like a safety facility services company and one of my clients was has like five one gallon containers full of serps that are full, but they lost like the ship back labels that they bought them with. And I see that you guys have a location in Milwaukee, 1919, what's North Avenue? I was wondering if she could just rock them off there. I'm having a tough time like figuring out where to drop. What's your zip code? And I can look into some options here. Well, 530205 is 530205. Okay, got it. And is this a cell phone that you're on by chance? Yep. Okay, so I do know of a sharp location and I can text you their information. It's the highest pharmacy. Okay. So because some of a lot of these locations will only take, actually, so I think it is that one you're looking at. So I just texted you their direct line. If you want to call them directly, they can let you know, you know, what options they have. Yeah. So yeah, I'd start there. Okay. Otherwise, so yeah, because you're saying a lot of them only take resident, I'm sure they're like small quantity. Well, I'm looking a lot of them just take like pharmaceutical drop off and stuff. That one does show that they take sharp, sharp off. So I would start at that service. I will also text you another link. It's called ship insured where you can actually ship different items out. They'll destroy them and send you back a certificate of destruction. So you can look into options on that too as well if you'd like. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Bye.
