 Thank you for calling record nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. I'm trying to find somebody who could make a copy of the CD for me. It's my MRI that I got to send to a physician. Okay. We do very high volume scanning. That's not something that we would do, but I can refer you to maybe one of our walk-in locations. What's your zip code? I'm in Foxboro. I'm top of my head. I don't know what my zip code is. Okay. I think you were looking at maybe the Mansfield area. Yes. Okay. Let me see here. This is a cell phone. I can text you a couple locations that you can call. They can let you know what they handle. That would be great. All right. I just thank you a couple options there if you want to try to reach out to them. Okay. Thanks for your help. Thank you. Bye-bye. Okay. Bye.
