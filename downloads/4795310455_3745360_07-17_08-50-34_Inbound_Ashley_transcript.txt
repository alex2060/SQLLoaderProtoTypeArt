 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley, my name is Peter. I was wondering if you have services in Northwest Arkansas. Let me check the area. What's your zip code? 72758. 72758. Yes. How many file boxes or file drawers would you estimate you have in total? Roughly 27 boxes. And I say roughly because boxes, the regular size, file boxes, they are 17 of them. And then there's a file cabinet, one of those four essential cabinets. And I'm just estimating that would be about 10 boxes and estimating 27 boxes. Okay, so if everything were in file boxes, maybe 27. And is this at a business, residence, storage? Right now, this is a home, but that used to be my late husband's business. Okay, so that's the rest of the house. So let me gather a little information from you and then I'm going to have the shredder that does service the area. I get you some pricing and information. You said your first name is Pedro, correct? Pedro, PEDRO. Thank you. And what is your last name? Alegria, A-L-E-G-R-I-A. Perfect. And what's the best phone number to reach you with information? 479-531-0455. All right. Is there a secondary number you'd like us to have? That's the only one. Okay. And a good email address for you. P-A-L-M-L-E-F-E at gmail.com. Can you say B as in boy, A-L-M as in Mary? B-S-N, I have a known, the plant. Did you say T as in Tom? A P. Oh, T as in her name, Pedro. Correct. Okay. So it's P-A-L-M. Uh-huh. L-E-S-T as gmail. L-E-F-S in Frank. Well. Okay. L-E-F-E again, that's in Pedro. P-S-N Pedro, okay, perfect. That's a lot to have. P-A-L-M-L-E-F-P at gmail.com. Wonderful. All right. So Pedro, what I'll do here is I'm going to get this right over to the shredder that does service Rogers. They will contact you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well with some info on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. In that email, there will be a small section that also asks how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click, one-to-five-star review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Do you have the number that they're going to be calling me from? Because if your number is not in my phone, it's going to go, you know, I'm like, ignore it. Okay. I just sent you an email with their direct phone number. I don't know if it's the same outbound line that they'll be calling from, but if you need to call them directly, you can. So I did just go ahead and send that over to you. Is that okay? Let me see if we want to spam because I don't see it. I did not get your email. No, it wasn't popping up. Let me see here. Let me just verify that email address again, but I think I had it. All right. So again, on that email address, I have... P is in Paul. A is in Apple. L is in Larry. M is in Mary. L is in Larry. E is in Edward. F is in Frank. P is in Paul. A Gmail. P is in Paul.
