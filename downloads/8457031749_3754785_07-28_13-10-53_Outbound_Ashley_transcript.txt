 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi. I saw that you guys have a location, a rep store in Middletown. I was wondering how this works. Do I go there and shred myself? Do I drop it off? How is that work? There's a few options offered based on your volume. How many boxes or bags of shredding do you estimate you have? I'm going to say I have probably less one bag. I'm sorry, how many? I'm not writing catchlots. How many boxes or bags? One bag. So with that amount, your best option is a drop off service. There is a UPS store right there off of 211E. And I can transfer you to that location if you'd like to get info on that. Sure. Could I do it myself while we're there or do they have to do it? No, they don't shred it while they're there. There's something that you drop off to them. They hang on to it until it's shredded later. Is there usually a secure bin or something like that? Yeah, unfortunately, that's not something that they would do right there in front of you. Okay. All right. Sure. Can you transfer me over please? Yeah, one moment.
