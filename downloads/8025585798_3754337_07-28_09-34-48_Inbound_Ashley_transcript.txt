 Thank you for calling Shrednation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, I was just calling just to see I have a couple boxes of paper stuff that needs to be shredded. Can I just drop them off at a location? I know where there's one close by here. Do they just weigh it and then do it or do I have to wait around for them to do it for me? So the drop off locations don't do any shredding there. They'll collect shredding and then have it shredded at a later date. They accept small amounts. So is that what you're interested in and dropping off? Yes, I'm just going to drop something off. And they'll weigh it and then I'll pay for that whatever it is, right? Correct. What is your zip code and I can manage them drop off from your buy? zip code is 68118. 68118. All righty, is this a phone that you're on? So phone, yes. Okay, so what I can do is text you a couple of locations that you offer the drop off services. If you reach out to them, they're actually going to let you know what they charge and if there's room in there, bin. So I want to hand send that over and then what is your first name? Linda. Linda, perfect, Linda. Let me go ahead and get that sent right over to you. I will send you another text as well. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that'd be appreciated. Okay. All right. Thank you. Have a good day. Mm-hmm. Bye.
