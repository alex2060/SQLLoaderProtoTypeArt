 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? I have like a hundred boxes of old files that I need to get rid of if you're at my hotel. Okay. What's the zip code of the hotel there? 23188. All right. And what's the name of the hotel? It's a roadway in. That R.O.T.R.H.O.A.D.? It's R.O.D.E.W.A.Y. So I don't know why this fell at all. All right. I knew it felt differently, but I obviously got it off. Okay. So let me get this to Mimpo. And then I'll have this better get you some pricing and information. What's your first and last name? It's Chris with a C. And my last name is Mark P. M-A-R-Q-U-I-F. Thank you. And what's the best phone number to reach you with information? 757. 784. 7339. All right. Is there a secondary number you'd like us to have? Well, give us a thought. It's an office phone number. It's 757. 707. 8687. All right. And a good email. It's my name is Chris. Mark P. At Stay at Choice.com. The Chris.M-A-R-Q-U-I-S at Stay at Choice.com. That's it. Perfect. So I'm going to get this right over to the three shredders that do service that area there in Williamsburg. Each of them are going to contact you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well with some info on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. In that email, I'm going to also just be a small section Chris that's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-foot review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye-bye.
