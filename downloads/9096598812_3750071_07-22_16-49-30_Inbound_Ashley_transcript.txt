 Thank you for calling medical waste pros. This is Ashley. How can I help you? I ask the other closest to my needles to do. Okay. You're looking for some sharpest foes. What's your zip code? 92545. 92545. Okay. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. So I can text you a couple of locations. I am seeing that these may just offer pharmaceutical drop-offs. I don't know if they handle sharps. We do list another option. It's a website called Ship and Shred where you can actually ship items out. They would shred them and then destroy them and send you back a certificate. I can give you some information on that if you'd like. No, because it's the needles that I want. It's something I could just take there. Let the reddit container and drop them off and that's it. Yeah. I have some pharmacies. I'm happy to text you a couple of options I have. I believe they only take pharmaceuticals but you can always ask. So I'll text you a couple of these pharmacies that I do know except some types of that. You can put them out here. There's a Beaumont pharmacy in Hitch in Hyden. Yep. That's a Beaumont pharmacy there. There's a smart care pharmacy as well. So I'll text you some direct phone numbers for both those locations. Okay. Okay. Is there any charge for them to do that for me? I don't know. Like I said, you'll have to even see if they accept the sharp disposal. But they'd have a good idea if not, maybe they would know where you could take it. So they'll get you any details on that. Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you. I'll see you. Bye. Bye.
