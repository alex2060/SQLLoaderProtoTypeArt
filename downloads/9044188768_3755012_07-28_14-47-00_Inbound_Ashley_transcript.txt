 Hello. Yeah, this is Ashley with shred nations. How can I help you? I'm looking at injects of air. I would want to do. I provide public service. Shredding. Like free shredding is what you mean or. If it's free, I do. I need to get a quote like I'm asking. I just didn't know what public service shredding was. We have shredding services for businesses, residential, whatever you have. How many boxes or bags of shredding do you have? Just one bit. With that in mind, you're going to want to look into a drop-off location. Those are going to be used. What's your zip code? I'm going to put it in a little bit. Oh, because it's said provide community community shredding. That's what maybe I said for me. I'm going to be okay. Are you looking for a shred event maybe or something? So you can always look into it. That's exactly what it is. Okay, we work with companies who like host shred events. Um, look, and so, but we don't actually have a calendar of those or have any. Um, you know, say on who goes to those. So you can always look into your area for shred events, but we don't offer those directly. Yeah, okay, yes, ma'am. All right. All right. So yeah, if you, um, the other couple options are looking into drop-off locations like UPS stores, mail centers, things like that. They'll charge by the pound for you to leave small amounts of shredding with them. Okay, so that's a bad amount. Okay, so my, okay, yeah, I have a big like not big, but it's a trash bag. But it's not like filled up with. Yeah, I get what you're saying. Yeah. Okay, so any any, um, you say any year by UPS store? A lot of them offer it. It's always a good idea to call first to make sure there's room in their bin and let you know what they charge and verify that they offer that. But yeah, that's what I would do with anything less than 90 pounds. Okay, yes, ma'am. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Bye.
