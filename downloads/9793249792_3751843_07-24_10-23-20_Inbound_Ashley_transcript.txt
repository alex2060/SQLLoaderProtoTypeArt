 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, you don't shred new shredding. Yeah, we do offer shredding services. How many boxes or bags of shredding do you have? Well, it's going to be a bunch, but I don't have to start collecting all my old papers. And I'm just thinking how much you would charge. I'm what I would charge for it. Okay. So if it's a small amount of shredding like three boxes or less, and you don't need to witness the shredding drop off the grade option, if it's anything more than a few boxes, then the better option is a truck service that would come to you. I think I will have maybe four garbage bags. Okay. And are these black line relief bags, kitchen bags? Garbage bag. I mean, oh, lawn. Every, you know, larger lawn and leaf. And what is your zip code? Oh, the middle size one. Pardon? What's the zip code there? Oh, just my old water bills, everything that I should have done. Oh, sorry. Your zip code, not the nature of the document. Oh, is that code that you're in? Okay. 7, 7, 8, 0, 2, did you say? Yes, ma'am. Okay. So there's a service where a truck can come directly to your location. It would shred right there on site while you watch. For anything up to 300 pounds or about nine bags worth of shredding, it's $155 for that service. Okay. And if I bring in them and just so many boxes, like three boxes, I'm not sure what he's going to do. If you look into three boxes or less, that's like UPS stores, mail centers, things like that that would offer a drop-off service. You would just have to call them directly to see what they charge per pound. But yeah, then the other option is a truck service that comes to you. Oh, okay. That is $105. Correct. Okay. What, thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
