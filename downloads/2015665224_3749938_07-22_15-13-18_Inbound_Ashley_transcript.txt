 Thank you for calling Shrednation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi. I'm just hoping to get a quote for a Shredding Services. Sure. How many boxes or file drawers of shredding would you estimate that you have? It's probably like three boxes. OK. So with a few boxes, if you don't need to witness to the shredding, drop-offs can be a good option for you. Those are going to be UPS stores, mail centers, things like that that offer drop-offs. I can get you in touch with those services, if you'd like. Sure. OK. What's your zip code? 0703. OK. And is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. OK. So what I think you was, I'm going to text you a couple of locations that offer a drop-off service. If you reach out to them directly, they can let you know what they charge and if there's room in their bin. So I'll text you those options now. And then what is your first name? Book H-O-P-E. Thank you. Hope I did text you a couple of options if you'd like to call around. I am going to send you another text as well. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Sure. Bye. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Bye-bye.
