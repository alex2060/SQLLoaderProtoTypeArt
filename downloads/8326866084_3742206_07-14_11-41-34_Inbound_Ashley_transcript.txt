 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. I just wanted to know how does it work? Like, can I just go walk in and drop off? Um, something to be shredded? Yeah, so there's a few options that are offered based on your volume. How many file boxes or file drawers of Shredding, US, and meat you have in total? Just one box, like a medium sized box, like this. Okay. Yeah, so with one box, as long as you don't need to witness the Shredding, drop off is a great option for you. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yeah. Okay, so I can text you a couple of locations that you offer the drop off services. What is your zip code and I can see what's nearby? 747406. 747406, got it? And is this a, you just say this is a cell phone. Okay, so I'm going to text you a couple of options that offer the services. If you reach out to them, they'll get you some information on this. And then I will send you another text as well. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one click, one to five star review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that'd be appreciated. Okay. That was good. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day. Bye bye. You too.
