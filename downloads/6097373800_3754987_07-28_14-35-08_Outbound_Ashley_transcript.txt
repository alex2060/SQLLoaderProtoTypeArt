 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. I'm calling, regarding helping Shredding some documents. Okay. And I saw your number. I'm in the Ewing Pennington area in New Jersey. Okay. I don't know how many file boxes or files were as a shredding. Do you estimate you have? I probably just have one file box left, which is easier for you to do than my at-home shredder. Okay. Well, there is a drop-off service for the small options or for small amounts. So there's the UPS or office that denial road and I can transfer you there if you'd like. Yes, that's great. Thank you. All right. Hold on just a moment. Do now.
