 Hello. Hi. Oh, hi. Yeah, this is Ashley with Record Nations. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. My name is Rita. I am the office supervisor for a dental office that we have downtown. And we are currently looking for service for our sharks containers. We have a good amount that needs to be disposed. And we were looking around at different services here in the matrix bill that I was wondering what that was looked like cost wise. Okay. What's your zip code? For the office today, 9301. Okay. And how often would you need a shark's disposal service? I would say probably like once a month, but we haven't had a service for our office in a couple months. So we have about 30 containers right now that would need to be disposed. Okay. So you have 30 containers and then you're also looking for a monthly service. Yes. Okay. Perfect. Let me gather a little information from you. And then I'll have the medical waste providers for the area. Get you some information on this. You've had your first name as Rita. Okay. Yeah. Rita Castro. C-A-S-C-R-O. C-A-S-T-R-O. All right. And the best phone number to reach you? That would be 661-820-1372. All right. Is there a secondary phone number that you think is like us to have? No, that's okay. This one will be fine. Okay. And a good email address for you. That would be M-P-C as in mom's dad's cat. I'm sorry. M-P-C-P-C with an S with the N at gmail.com. David, C is in cat. Patience with an S at gmail.com? Yes. Okay. And then, all right. So what I'll go ahead and do here is I'm going to get this, excuse me, right over to the medical waste providers. There's two medical waste providers at service to the area. So each of them will contact you to information. Okay. Well, some info on is it's going to be in touch with? And there will be a small section that also at customer service was today. Quick, one click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Yeah, of course. We'll have them in touch. You have a good day. You too. Bye-bye.
