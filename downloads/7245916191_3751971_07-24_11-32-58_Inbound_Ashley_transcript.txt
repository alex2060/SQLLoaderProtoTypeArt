 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Oh, hi. I'm in Philadelphia and I have a couple of small containers of household sharps and trying to figure out where to safely get rid of those. Do you guys do that service? Yeah. So if you have a small amount of shredding and you don't need to witness the shredding, you can look into a drop-off application. I'm sorry. I meant sharps. Oh, this is like metal. Like metal? Like metal coaxial looking for. Okay. What is your other code? 19106. Perfect. Okay. Is this a one-time need or an ongoing service? Like one time. One time. There's two small household size containers. Okay. And this is for a business or personal? Personal. So I can text you a couple of locations of some medical waste providers that do service the area. Okay. And it's actually showing an aesthetic location. Some of the pharmacies, I believe they only take pharmaceuticals, but I can text you one nearby just if you want to check. But yeah, if you reach out to the locations directly, they can let you know what they accept and what they charge. And then what is your first thing? It's for my daughter, Emma. Emma. Okay. So I did go ahead and send that information right over to you. I did send another text. I'm just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. If you get a moment for that as well, that'd be appreciated. Okay. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye. Okay. Bye-bye.
