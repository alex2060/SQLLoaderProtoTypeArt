 Thank you for calling the shred nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yeah, I was calling. Are you located up around by Wal-Martin in Carney? I met our corporate office. That location you were looking at is most likely a drop off UPS store. How many boxes or bags of shredding just made that you have? We just have one of those totes that we need to have shredded. It's a tote that we put our personal bills and statements and stuff in. And then we save them for like five years and then we pull them out and we need to get them shredded, I guess. If it's less than 90 pounds and you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off the great options for you. I can get you some information on that. What's your zip code? 68939. 68939. Alrighty. And how many file bar, I'm sorry, said just a couple. So this is a cell phone. Let me text you a couple of locations that you offer the drop off services. It shows our encourage. If you want to reach out to them directly, they're like the UPS store. It's the Midwest connects. If you reach out to them, they'll let you know what they charge and if there's room in their bin. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Thank you. Yep, you too. Thank you.
