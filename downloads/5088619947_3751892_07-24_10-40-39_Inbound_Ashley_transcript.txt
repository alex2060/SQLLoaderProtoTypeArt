 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yeah. Somebody just tried to give me a call. I had submitted a form about getting a quote. Okay. Let me try to pull up your information here. Thank you. And what's your zip code? 02052. And what is your name? Matthew Greening. All right. Matthew, I do see your information here. Are there shredding that you have? Is this located at a business, residence, storage, residence? All right. And how many file boxes or file doors are shredding? Do you have to meet you? So here's the thing. Do you know those big grates that you put like Christmas stuff in? They're like green or blue. You know what I mean? They're like a rubber maiden. Yeah. So I was looking up and it says that those are about like one point, like 1.7 to two cubic feet. And then we were eyeballed. We have two of those crates. We think it's probably around like six banker boxes. If we had to guess, and that's probably been on the high side. And we may have one or two more just when we go through our last little bit. So most of your eight banker's boxes. So maybe eight buck banker boxes were with us. Yeah. Perfect. So what I'll go ahead and do here. Let me see. So there is a shredder that does service the mid-celled area. So what I'll do is get this right over to the shredder that services your location. They're going to contact you back as soon as they get a moment with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well. It's going to have some info on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. In that email, there is going to be a small section that does ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one click review. If you get a moment for that, that would be appreciated. Yeah. And I'll have them in touch with you as soon as they get a moment. Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye bye. Oh no.
