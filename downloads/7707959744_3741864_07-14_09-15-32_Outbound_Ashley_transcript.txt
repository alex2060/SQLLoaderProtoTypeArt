 Hello. Yes, hi. This is Ashley with Shred Nation. I'm sorry. I don't have any help you. Yeah. Called last week and I set up for you guys to come out and do some shredding at my house for some files. And they said they'd be here today. But they're showing off. They never really gave me a time when they'd be here. But the guys just say that you called me in the morning. Let me know. Okay. So I see. Yes, we got you in touch on the seventh with A1 shredding and recycling. That was our partner. Let me give you their direct number. And then I'll transfer you to them. Okay. Now do I pay them or do I pay you guys? It's directly with them so that the service is directed to them. So they're direct phone number 770. 795. Okay. 944. Okay. All right. And I will transfer you now so they can get you some info on that. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yep. One moment. Thank you for calling. Thank you.
