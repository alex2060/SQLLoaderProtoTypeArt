 Thank you for calling Stred Nation. This is that. How's it help you? Hi, this is Wendy Anderson. I'm calling up regarding business, shred, quote, mobile shred. Yeah, so you're looking for mobile services? Yes, in Tyler, Texas. Okay, I see your information in here that you sent that request. I'm looking for ongoing month services. Yes, in fact, it might even be quarterly if you all do that. Yeah, there's by-monthly options, there's a quarterly option every few months. Okay. So you want to look in there quarterly? Yes, we really just don't have a lot, but obviously. Okay. We have to. Yeah. So we have a small council that holds about four file boxes. We're just shredding, and then a larger rolling bin. That holds about 10 file boxes. What size do you think you would need? The small for sure. Okay. So what we'll go ahead and do here, I'm going to get this information right over to the shredder that does service Tyler. They'll contact you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well. It's going to have some information on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. In that email, there'll also just be a small section that does ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Well, we will have them in touch as soon as they get a moment. You have a great day. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
