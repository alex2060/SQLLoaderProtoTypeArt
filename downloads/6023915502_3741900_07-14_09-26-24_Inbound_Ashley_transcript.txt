 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. That's it Ashley. How can I help you? I actually have some residential customer and I'd like to give an estimate on shredding and some paper. How much? Okay. Yeah, how many file boxes or file doors of shredding do you estimate you have in total? Well, it's in various size boxes. So I mean, I don't, it's maybe not in no five, five, six, bank of boxes at most. Okay. And what's the zip code of where it's located? I'm sorry, what? What's your zip code of where it's located? 8, 5, 2, 5, 7. I'm going to bring it in. You... Unfortunately, with that amount, there's no drop-off location that we list that can handle more than two or three file boxes. So if it's anything more than that, the better option is a truck service that comes to you. So that's what I can get you a quote on. Okay. All right. Well, I'm not sure if I have that, if I have that much attention boxes and different size boxes. So how much would, how much volume does a drop-off service handle? I'm sorry. What was the question? So if I just wanted to bring it in, you're saying, I don't think I... Maybe I don't sound that much. I mean, with the zip file boxes or less, drop-off is a great option. Once it gets anything more than a few boxes, the most cost-effective option is generally the truck that comes to you. It gets pretty expensive to take anything more than a small amount to the UPS store, which are the drop-off services. So yeah, I mean, you're welcome to call the UPS store and discuss with them how much they can handle what they charge for pounds. And then from there, you know, if you decide you need a truck quote, you can always call it back. Okay. All right. I said I was... Okay. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye.
