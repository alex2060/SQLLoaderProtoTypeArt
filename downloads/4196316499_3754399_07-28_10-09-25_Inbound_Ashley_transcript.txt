 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, Ashley. If I walk into one of your Shred Nations locations, I live in Columbus. You have a Bethel Road location. Do I need an appointment to drop off and watch some documents being shredded or do I just go in and have it done? So unfortunately none of those locations are going to shred anything on site there. Those locations are collected, so it's shredded later. If you wanted to witness the shredding, then that's services where a truck comes to you to shred on site. Mm-hmm. Okay. How many boxes are bags of shredding do you have? Not a lot. It's household papers from a couple households. Not a lot. Okay, so if it's less than 90 pounds or less than three file boxes, drop off is a good option for you as long as you're okay without witnessing the shredding or if you want to witness that I could get you a quote on a truck coming to you. No, that's not necessary. What about the most iPhones or cell phones? What's the cost per one phone? They don't accept those. They drop off UPS stores. They only accept paper, but what's your zip code? 43235. 43235, okay. And this is a cell phone that you're on. I am on the cell phone right now. Yes, this is not the phone, but I want to get rid of. Okay. I'm going to text you a couple locations that you accept the electronic recycling. If you want to reach out to them directly, they can get you some information on what they charge for recycling certain items. And then I will send you a couple locations that accept the paper drop off as well. If you decide to go that route, you would just want to call them directly and then I'll let you know what they charge if there's room in there. Thank you very much. Thank you. And I sent you one other text. It's just going to be asking how my customer service was today. It's a quick, one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that'd be appreciated. All right. Thank you, Ashley. Thank you. Bye-bye.
