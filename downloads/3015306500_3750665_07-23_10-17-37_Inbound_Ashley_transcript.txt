 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? How are you? How are you? How are you? I'm good. My office is located in Rockville, Maryland. And we've used you in the past, but it's been several years. We haven't had to have a shred since COVID hit. But I need to get a couple bins placed throughout the office. And I do not remember from seven years ago how we did it. Okay. What's your zip code? And I can look into some options. 208-55. Perfect. And the shredding that you have, this is an ongoing service you're looking for? No. It would just what we typically do is place some bins around the office and leave them here for like a week. And then you guys pick them up and shred them on site. Okay. Generally they'll leave bins if it's like an ongoing service. We'll see if that's an option for just a one-time purge. Roughly how many bins do you think you could fill for your estimate? I don't know. I'm going to say, I mean, we haven't had much paper since COVID, but we've got some less of it. I don't know. I would say four to five. Maybe. Sure. It's a total get. It'll get. So if you're a user, I would like to have a learning. I would like to have a learning. I would like to have a learning.
