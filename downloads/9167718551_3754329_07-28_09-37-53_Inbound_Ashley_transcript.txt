 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. We have some boxes that need to be shredded about 24 boxes. Is that something you guys could do if we drop them off? So unfortunately drop off is for small amounts, not for anything more than a few boxes. So with that, that would be a service where a truck actually comes to you to shred. How much is that? What's your zip code? 95661. 95661. Is this at a business, resident, storage? It's a business. Okay. So yeah, let me gather a little info from you here. I'm going to have to have the shredder that does service the Roseville area contact you directly with a quote. What's your first and last name? You know that's fine. I'm trying to look, I got to get rid of this. Ace, if you don't have time to do all that, so I can't wait for quotes. I'll call the smother places. Thank you. Okay.
