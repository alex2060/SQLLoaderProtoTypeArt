 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. I have a Shred setup for today at Windows starting at 10 a.m. I wanted to see where it's still trying to go through a couple of the boxes I wanted to see as actively scheduled for a couple of days. You're in any to speak with the company we got you in touch with? It looks like you scheduled with Shred Northwest. I can give you their phone number and then transfer you to them. Oh yeah, that'd be great once again. Alright. Okay, what's the number? The number is 503-669-04060. Perfect, thank you. You're welcome one moment.
