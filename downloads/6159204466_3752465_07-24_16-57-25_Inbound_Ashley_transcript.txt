 Thank you for hauling Shred Nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Ashley, I'm looking forward to see if you have any pickups available for tomorrow. So if you are looking to speak with the scheduling department for the Shredder, you'd have to speak with the Shredder for your area. What's your zip code? 37138. 37138? Yes. And did you already receive a quote? No, I mean yes. Okay. So yeah, generally the truck service is going to be scheduled out a little further, but you would have to speak with them directly to see what that scheduled looking like. So if you have some flexibility, I can have that scheduler in touch with availability for you. Okay. So let me gather some information here. What is your first and last name? Tim Jefferson. Tim Jefferson? Yes. And what is the best phone number to reach you with information? 6159204466. All right. Is there a secondary phone number that you'd like us to have? 6154792547. All right. Second numbers, Kim. The second numbers, Kim, the first number is Roger. Okay. Also, first name is Roger and then Kim. Yes. All right. Perfect. And is there a good email address to get some information to you? You said email? Yes. There an email address we can get some information to you. Right. Dale Daniels at Gmail. It's R-Y-D-E-L-L Daniels. D-A-N-I-E-L-S at Gmail. Yes. Okay. All right. And then what is the address the truck will be going to? 19, 0, 9, My lane, M-Y-L-E-E-N place. All right. Okay. Tennessee. All righty. So I'll have the scheduling department in touch with you with some information and then I will send you an email with some additional info. And that email will be a small section that does the Ask How My Customer Service was today. It's a quick, one-click review. So if you do get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. I was terrible. Well, then I guess you just sell the shoes on there. That's whatever you want to do. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. We'll have them in a great day. All right. Thanks. Thank you. Bye-bye.
