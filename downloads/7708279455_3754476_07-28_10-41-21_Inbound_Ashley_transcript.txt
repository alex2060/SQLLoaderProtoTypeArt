 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hey, I'm in Atlanta. I was wondering how much it was to shred stuff. I'm just a consumer. You know, bring boxy boxes and stuff. Okay. How many boxes did you say? That's probably three or so. Three. Okay. Yeah. So drop off locations are great for smaller amounts. Just shredding about three file boxes are less. What's your zip code and I can see what's nearby? I see one on Google Maps. It's a 30306. 30306. Got it. Okay. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yeah. Okay. What I can do is actually text you a couple of locations that offer the drop off services. If you call them directly, they'll let you know what they charge per pound and if there's room in their bin. So I'll send that to you now. And what is your first name? Katie. Okay. So when I send that over to you, Brady, I will send you over another text. You're just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. If you get a moment for that as well, that'd be appreciated. How much is it? They all set their own pricing per pound. So you'll want to reach out to those locations. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye-bye.
