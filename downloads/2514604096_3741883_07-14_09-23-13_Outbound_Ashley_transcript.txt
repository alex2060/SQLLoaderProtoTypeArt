 Thank you for calling Shredding. This is actually how can I help you? Yes, or you don't? Y'all locate on University Boulevard. So I'm at our corporate office. That location may be a drop off location for small amounts of paper. How many boxes are bags of shredding? You have to check. How many boxes I got three garbage bags for? Okay. So with a few bags, as long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off is a great option for you. What's your zip code and I can see what's nearby? Oh, 3665. 3665. 3665. Got it. Okay. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Oh, no. It's a home phone. Landline. Okay. So then I can transfer you near that area. There is a UPS store off of... There's one off the airport Boulevard and one off the old Shell Road. What is it? There are UPS stores that offer drop off service. Oh, okay. So I can transfer you to the UPS store off the airport Boulevard. They can let you know what they charge and if there's room in there then. Okay. All right, hold on just a moment.
