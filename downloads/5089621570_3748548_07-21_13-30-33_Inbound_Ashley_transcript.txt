 Thank you for calling records. Ashley, how's it going to help you? Yeah, could you tell me, do you do photo scanning? We can offer photo scanning, but we do very high volume scanning. How many photos do you have? Oh, there's a couple of shoe boxes anyway. I mean, I don't know, probably a thousand or so. Okay, what's your zip code? I'm a, what's the zip code here? Oh, three, four, two, three, two, four. I'm not even sure. I'm in Lakonia. Is this one of those agencies? You got to mail it in? No, no, I can try to refer you somewhere or I can see if you meet our minimum, but I would need to know where you are. Lakonia. Why need a zip code? I'm sorry. Okay, thank you. All right.
