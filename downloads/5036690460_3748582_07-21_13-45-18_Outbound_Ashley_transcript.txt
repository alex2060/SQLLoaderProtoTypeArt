What's your zip code? The zip code for the office is 97219. Okay. And do you have a rough idea of how many file boxes or files were the shredding that you may have? I actually have no idea. It's a relatively small office. It looks like there's just, there's like four filing cabinets. Okay. So four filing cabinets are a lot more information because I, just your best at the minute's fine. You know these like four or five drawer file cabinets? I'm going to look at the pictures once I can. Okay. There's, so there's two six drawer filing cabinets. Two six drawer. And that's the total. I'm trying to get out of these. Okay. And are those two six drawer cabinets? Are they the square vertical drawers or the wide lateral? Wide lateral. Okay. I mean they could be empty for all I know.
