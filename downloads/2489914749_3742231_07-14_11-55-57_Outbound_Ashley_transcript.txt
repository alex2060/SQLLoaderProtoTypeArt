 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. I'm calling to see your charge for picking up paper slackeners that I need shredded. Okay. I have like a large threading pod that has to fill and then I probably have one or two of those leaf bags that are filled. Okay. Everything we're in small file boxes. How many of those do you think you could fill? Oh boy. Maybe... Can? Yeah. It's hard to pick up. Okay. I don't know. Maybe six. I don't know. I'd have to... Six to ten maybe. Okay. What's that code? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What is your zip code? 4-8-301. All right. And is this at a resident or a business? The resident. Okay. So there are services where a truck can come to the residents there. Let me gather a little info from you and then I'm going to have the shredder that does service the area. I get you some pricing and some information. What is your first and last name? Roseanne, ROSA and NDE. Lesson, Vomans, V-Like Victor, O-L-L-M-A-N. You don't have like a rough idea before we go through all this, do you? Unfortunately, I don't.
