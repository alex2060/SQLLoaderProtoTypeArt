 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi. Do you guys just, I've got a storage locker, just a personal storage locker. We've got a lot of paper files that need to be shredded. Okay. How would you guys charge for that? Yeah. So how many file boxes or file drawers are shredding would you estimate there are? You know what? I actually have no idea at all. I think we have a 10 by 20 locker. And I would say maybe we have 10 to 15 foot wall with, you know, maybe 10 feet high shelves with file boxes on it. So I haven't even done the calculations to figure out how much 10 wouldn't be. But it's not like, you know, I mean, we calculate 20 plus boxes, 50 plus 100 plus. Okay. I would say four to 20. Let's say between 20 and 50. Let's say close to 50. Close to 50. You said 50. Say that again. I'm sorry. I'm having a hard time hearing you. Did you say 50, 5, 0? Yes. I'm sorry. Okay. Perfect. And what's the zip code of where that's located? 64082. And do you guys only send trucks out to do it? Or can we rent a machine shredder ourselves? Or what are your options? We don't rent the industrial shredders, but there's options where the truck can come to you and shred curbside so you can witness. Oh, shredding me. And that's just okay. So you offer the option for us to bring the paper to you? No, unfortunately, the only drop off locations except like three boxes or less. And so you can't bring it to us either. Got it. But what I'll do is have those trucks get you a quote on this. And did you say it has a facility or a business residence? It is at a storage locker facility, a public storage locker. Okay, storage facility. Okay. And what is your first time last name? Laurie L. A. U. R. I. E. Woodworth W-O-O-D-W-O-R-T-H. All right. And what's the best phone number to reach you with information? 816-668-5548. All right. Is there a secondary phone number you'd like us to have? No. That'll do it. Okay. And a good email address for you. Let's see. Use the letter L. Wood W-O-O-D-Junk Mail at Gmail. So it's L. WoodJunkMail at Gmail.com? Yes. Okay. So Laurie, there's two shredders that do service leave summit. Each of them are going to contact you directly with some pricing and information on the truck service coming to the storage facility there. Okay. And then I will send you an email as well. It's going to have some information on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. In that email, there'll also be a small section that does ask how my customer service wants today. It's a quick one-click review. Just to get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. I appreciate it. And again, so, and you are, I call it a shred nation? Shred nation. You have been over it. Okay. And so, you, your company name shred nation will be on the email. So I can keep track of who I've called. That's me. I'm correct. And the files of the two companies that are going to be in touch with you will also be in that email. Okay. Great. And will anybody be texting me? Any communication? Or will it all be in the email? First, you can always speak with them later to see if they have text capabilities that it's generally okay. Okay. Great. And if I'm unable to answer the phone, will they leave all the information in the voicemail? I don't, they'll probably have to talk with you, but they should leave a voicemail. And if you feel like you've missed them, feel free to call them directly. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Good day. Bye-bye.
