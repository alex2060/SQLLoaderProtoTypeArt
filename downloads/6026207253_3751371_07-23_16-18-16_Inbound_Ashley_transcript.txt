 Thank you for following Shredtronics. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yeah. Oh, sweet. How much is charged for three, you know, like a file box is out of papers? Okay. So with a few boxes, we would refer you to a drop off locations. Those are going to be UPS stores, mail centers, things like that. If you don't need to witness your shredding, that's a good option for you. Oh, hello. What's your zip code? 8-5233. 8-5233. Oh, hello. Alrighty. And is this paper shredding that you're looking for, correct? Yeah, paper shredding. Okay. So this is a cell phone that you're on. What I can do is text you a couple of locations that you offer the drop off services. If you reach out to them directly, they'll let you know what they charge and if there's room in there. So go ahead and send that over to you. And then what is your first name? But I got a e-mail. Thank you. So I did go ahead and send that information right over to you. I will send you another text, Margarita. It's just going to ask how my customer service was. So if you get a moment for that, it's a quick one to five star review. That would be appreciated. Oh, yeah. I'll go ahead and text you those locations if you'd like to call them. What else do you have? You shred our electronics. Is that it? What is it? We do have some partners. I handle electronics as well. What types of electronics do you have? One computer. One computer. Okay. So I can text you some information on who accepts electronics. Let me see here. There is a... I'm sorry. I'm going to see what's closest to you. So we do have a local computer repair location that does accept recycling of computers. So you can call them directly as well. And I texted you there and so also. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Okay.
