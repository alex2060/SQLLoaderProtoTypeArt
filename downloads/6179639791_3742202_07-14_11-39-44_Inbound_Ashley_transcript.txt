 Thank you for calling for stress. How can I help? Hi, you following on, I got a couple of bags off of school paperwork that I want to shred. Okay, yeah, but just a couple bags and you don't need to witness the shredding. Drop-off can be a great option. What's your zip code and I can see what's nearby? It's 02370. 02370. Okay, so this is a cell phone. I can actually text you a couple of locations that offer the drop-off services. If you reach out to them directly, they'll let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. Okay. I want to set that over to you. And what is your first name? Eddie. Perfect, Eddie. Well, I did go ahead and get that since you. I will send you another text. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. Okay. So please give me a quick one click, one to five star review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. All right, thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. One.
