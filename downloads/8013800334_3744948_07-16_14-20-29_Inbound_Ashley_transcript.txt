 Thank you for calling record nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, Ashley. I have a question. I have a personal journal. Most of it is all typed written about 300 pages. You digitize anything like that. So, depends on, we do pretty high volume scanning that might not be our minimum, what's your zip code? I'm sorry. You're breaking up. I can barely hear you. Oh, I'm sorry. What is your zip code? 84004. Okay. I'm going to see if you meet our minimum for the area. Unfortunately, you don't. Our minimum is going to start in, you know, 10,000 images or more. But I can try to refer you somewhere. Is your cell phone that you're on? I'm sorry. Are you on a cell phone? Yes. So, I'm going to text you a couple of locations you can call. I believe they offer some scanning and they can get you some information, okay? Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye-bye.
