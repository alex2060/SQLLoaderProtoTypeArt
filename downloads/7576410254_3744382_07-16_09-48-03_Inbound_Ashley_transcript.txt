 Thank you for calling medical waste pros. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, I have some old oxygen tank. The company has closed down. Do you know how it could dispose of them? You know, I can try to refer you to someone that might be able to help. What's your zip code? 48307. 48307, okay. Let's be here. So I do have some different pharmacies that I believe they only handle pharmaceuticals. I don't believe they would take your oxygen tanks. But I can try to refer you to a couple of these to call around and they might have a better idea of who would offer that. Okay. This is a cell phone I can text you a couple options. Yes, ma'am. Okay. I'm going to send you a couple locations. If you want to try to call them, they might be able to handle it. If not, they're at least a little closer to your area. They might be able to point you in the right direction. Okay. Thanks so much. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
