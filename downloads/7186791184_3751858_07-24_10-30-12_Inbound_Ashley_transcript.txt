 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. So, this is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, Ashley. I think somebody called me yesterday. Said that somebody else was going to call for a quote. Okay. They're waiting. All right. I do see your information here as this Frank. Yes. So, we got you to our partner global document services. If you haven't heard from them, let me give you their phone number. I can't write it down right now. Okay. We did all three email it to you if you'd like. Okay. Call them directly. They should be the ones to get you any sort of information. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Bye.
