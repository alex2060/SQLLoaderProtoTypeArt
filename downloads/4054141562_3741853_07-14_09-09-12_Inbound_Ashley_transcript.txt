 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. Do you do just drop off shredding? We do let some drop off options. How many boxes or bags are shredding to you? I have like one garbage bag full, small garbage bag, maybe 20 pounds. Okay. As long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off is a great option for you. What is your zip code? 731-700. All right. And is this a cell phone that you're on? Yeah. So what I can do is I will text you a couple of locations that you offer a drop off service. If you reach out to them directly, they will let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. So I'll go ahead and send that over to you now. And what is your first name? Thomas. Thomas, perfect. I did go ahead and send that right over to you, Thomas. I will send you one other text that's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one click, one to five star review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. Have a good day. You too. Bye. Bye.
