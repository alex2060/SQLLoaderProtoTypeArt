 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi. Can you tell me if in Rapid City you're still located at 1601 Mount Rushmore Road number three? So that's not where I am, but that is where a drop-off location is most likely. They accept smaller amounts of shredding. Is that just what you have? Is this a small amount? Yeah, I have a small amount and I drove here and it's now I here for cutting a lot. So I'm not sure where this place is anymore. So. Okay, so you said it was the Mount Rushmore location? Yes. So I'm showing that that's a rapid packing mail that offers drop-off services for small amounts like three boxes or less. I'm happy to try to transfer you there if you'd like. Well, I see the packing mail, but I'll just go in there. Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye.
