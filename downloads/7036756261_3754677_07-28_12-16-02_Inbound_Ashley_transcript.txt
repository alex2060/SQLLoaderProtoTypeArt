 Thank you for calling Treadnations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Ashley, I have a very old W2 that were packed with my things that I need shredded. Okay. I am in Mount Pleasant. Do you do that type of service? Yeah, there are a couple options offered. If it is a small amount of shredding and you don't need to witness the shredding, we can refer you to a drop-off service. How many file boxes or trash bags worth of shredding do you estimate you have? It is not that much. It is like a small... Generally, it is a small amount. 90 pounds or less. The drop-offs can be a good option for you. What is your zip code? It is 22... I went blank. I just moved here. 2429. I did not do that. Wait, 26... 29... 2649. That is not showing up as a correct. 29... 2949. 2949. Okay. Let me check. I just moved. Okay. It is... Oh, Lord. Here we go. 2949. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Is this a cell phone that you are on? Yes. I can try the location. If you want to call those locations directly, they will be the one to let you know what they charge for pounds. Just keep in mind you don't witness the shredding. Okay. I want to get rid of the bank documents. You will have the call directly. They will accept all documents. I just texted you a couple of locations that you can call directly and their addresses are on there as well. Thank you so much. Have a great day.
