 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes. Is there a drop-off shredded location enrichment? We do list some different drop-off options for smaller amounts of shredding. How many boxes are bags to estimate you have in total? I've got five banker boxes. Okay. That may be too much for any drop-off location that we list. What's your zip code? Right now, I'm in 23228. 23228, got it. Okay. Let me see here. Yeah. So in that area, we do list some drop-off UPS stores. They only accept small amounts of shredding. So anything more than a smaller amount, a better option is a truck that would come to you. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you.
