 Thank you for calling for an action. This is that. Hi. I wanted to know if I could share some documents because I called the location on Ralph, but they said the shredder is full. Their bins are full. So they'll just take it. They won't shred it at the same time. I don't want to just keep my mail there. I would rather just have it shredded the day I come in. Call us out for me. So none of the walk-in locations are just going to shred it for you same day. But there are options where a truck can come to you and shred on site. That's going to be the only option where you can witness the shredding. That's bad. Oh, so I'm not going to, okay, so since I'm not going to witness the shredding, I'll just go with them and let them shred it. Okay, yeah. So those drop-offs usually have a secure location that they'll place that in or secure bin and then it's shredded later. So that would be a good option for smaller amounts. Okay, thank you. Thanks, Greg. Thank you. Bye-bye.
