What's the toe there? I can check. 93635. 93635. Yes, ma'am. Right. And that's at a residence or business. It's a ranch. OK. And how many file boxes or file doors are shredding? Do you estimate you have? Probably 10. Maybe more. I don't know. 10 plus maybe. And we're talking like small file boxes. Not the banker boxes. Like the two foot long ones. Yes. OK, so about 10 of those 10 plus. All right. Yeah. So with that amount, it would be a service where the truck would come to your location for the shredding. Let me gather a little info from you.
