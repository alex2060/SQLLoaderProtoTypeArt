 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, this is Roosevelt. I'm with Yelp. You said your name's Abby. My name is Ashley. Oh, Ashley, I'm sorry. I was looking for Abby. Are you a receptionist there? What does it that you do at Medical Race first? So I'm with Shred Nations here. I'm actually at our corporate office. We have a few different divisions, but we have one office here. There's no Abby out of this office, though. Oh, interesting. So would you have a contact for anyone at Medical Race Pro's that I might be able to get in contact with them and get the proper information? A lot of the times, if you just email customer support at medicalwayspro's.com, that's usually a good way to get it. This call may be monitored or recorded. OK, I'll try that. I appreciate your time. OK, thank you.
