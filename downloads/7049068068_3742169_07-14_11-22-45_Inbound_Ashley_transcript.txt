 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hey, Ashlyn. You can ask me or Ashlyn? Ashley. Oh, hey, Ashley. I'm sorry about that. No problem. Quick question for you. I have my mother on the line. She's looking to have some paper shredded. Look how you have about... Probably about two large bags of documents that need to be shredded. I don't think you said the 10 pounds or anything like that. Is that something that you got to handle on site there? They won't actually shred on site, but you can take steps to those locations. You'd pay by the pound to leave stuff in there to cure bin. So that's how those locations were. So with smaller amounts, that generally is going to be one of your best options. What's your zip code, and I can see what's nearby. 27302. 27302. Got it. Okay. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yeah, it's my cell phone. I have my mom on the line. Oh, hi. Hi, you're on. Hi there. So yeah, I can text you a couple of locations that do offer the drop-off services if you are interested in that. They would be the ones to let you know what they charge per pound and if there's room in their bin. Okay. Okay. So I'll go ahead and text you a couple of options now. And then yeah, they should be able to get you some information. And what is your name, ma'am? My name is Fonsetta. F-O-N-R-E-T-T-A. Pretty name. All right, Fonsetta, why did you go ahead and send that information right over Tia? I will send you one other text as well. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one click, one to five star review. If you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Thank you. Yep, thank you. You have a good day. Bye-bye. Okay. Thank you. Okay.
