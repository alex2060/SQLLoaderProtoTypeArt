 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, ma'am. I'm a resident of Winter Ontario. And I got some grocery bags full of documents, private information. I've had for the last 20 years and I want to get it shredded. Yeah. So dropping off at the UPS store is going to be your most cross effective best option with that amount. I can transfer you to that location if you'd like to speak with them. I'm sorry, I didn't get that, ma'am. I can transfer you to the UPS store if you'd like to get information on how the drop-off services work. Oh, I put a UPS, you said? Correct. And I can transfer you to them. Well, they got boxes like her. Yeah, they collect shredding until it's shredded at a later date. Oh, they'll do it there for me. They don't do it there. They collect it till it's shredded later. But let me transfer you to them. They'll get you info on what to do with that, okay? Okay.
