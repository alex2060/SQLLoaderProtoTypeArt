 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. The Airfield Hospital just transferred me over and I was just wondering, I'm trying to get rid of some old like start like the needles that we would use for like humera and I have a couple of those red containers. I'll transfer it me this way. Is that something that I could do here? So I'm at our corporate office for medical waste pros. If you're looking for some sort of drop off, I can try to help you with that. What is your zip code? 59106. 59106. Okay. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yeah, this is my work one but I have a different cell phone. My personal cell phone if I can put that one on fire or whatever you need. Okay. I can text you some information. Yeah, I can take whatever phone works best. Okay. My personal one is going to be 806. 292. 3784. All right. So I'll text that number. So we do list. It's a it's a pharmacy but you know I don't know if they take sharps. They might just take pharmaceuticals so you might want to call them first and just double check. And then there is a option called ship and shred where you can actually ship different items out. They'll destroy them and send you back a certificate of destruction and they do handle sharks as well. Okay. Let me see here. And this is personal. Is this a free service or do we pay for it? There is a fee for the services. So you would have to check on that website exactly how because this is just personal correct. Yes. Yes. Okay. So if you are interested in like the the sharps mail back service, I can get you in touch for someone who knows a little more on that. Okay. I'm going to try the three drop off place first and then okay. Sure. Let us know if you need that. Sure. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Bye bye.
