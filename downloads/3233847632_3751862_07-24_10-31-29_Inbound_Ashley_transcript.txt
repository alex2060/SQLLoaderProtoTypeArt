 Thank you for calling Shrednation with the last week. I'm going to help you. Hi, how you doing? Doing well, how are you? Fine, thank you. I was calling to see how much do you guys charge to shred documents? Yeah, so there's a few options that are offered based on your volume. How many boxes or bags are shredding do you estimate you have? I probably have one large, well, about one and a half large boxes. Okay. So, with anything less than 90 pounds, as long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop-offs can be a good option for you. What's your zip code? 9,000-eighths. 9,000-eighths. And is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. So, I can text you a couple locations that offer the drop-off services. If you want to reach out to them directly, they're going to let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. Don't go ahead and text you some options now. And then what is your first thing, sir? Dunbar. All right. Do you end VAR? Uh-huh. Perfect. I just get that sent to you, Dunbar. I will send you one other text. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick, one-click review. If you get a moment for that as well, that'd be appreciated. Okay. We'll do it. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you.
