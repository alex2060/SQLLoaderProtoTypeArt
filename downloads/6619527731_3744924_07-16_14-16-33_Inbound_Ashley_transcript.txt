 Thank you for this is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, how much do you charge for paper shreds? Yeah, there's a couple of things that are offered to be sent on your volume. How many boxes or bags are shredding do you estimate you have in total? Two bags about about 30 pounds. Okay, so with a couple bags as long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off is a good option for you. What is your zip code and I can still remember? I'm sorry? Hold on one second. 92663. 92663. Okay, so if this is a cell phone, I can text you a couple of locations that offer the drop off services. Well, I could have a couple of calls if I want to know how much. You have to call those locations directly to see what they charge for pounds. Forget it. Okay.
