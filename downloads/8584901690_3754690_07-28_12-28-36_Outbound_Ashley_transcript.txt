 Thank you for calling Shrednation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, I was, you're in town square, right? I'm at our corporate office, but are you looking for a drop-off location? Yeah. I thought you were the local, yeah, okay. Okay. I'm at Shrednation here, but I can get you some information. And the drop-off locations we list, those are UPS stores, mail centers, things like that. And they get small amounts. Who is on Claremont Mesa Boulevard in San Diego? Yeah, there's a UPS store there. I can transfer you as long as you just have a small amount. You're looking to drop off, correct? Is this a UPS store? It'll be the UPS store. I thought it was a UPS. How much they charge per pound? They do charge by the pound and they set their own pricing per pound. You will have to speak with them directly, but I can transfer you over there if you'd like. Yes, can I talk to them? Yeah, one moment.
