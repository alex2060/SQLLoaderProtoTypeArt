 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, I sent information. They said they needed additional information for me regarding shredding quote. Okay. Yeah. Let me see here. Did you see you already sent a request in? Is this for Carol? Correct. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Roughly how many file boxes are filed or are the shredding do you estimate that you have? You know, I guess a half a dozen. Okay. And is this located on a business resident storage? Well, I retired so that they're at my residence now. Okay. Let's see here. So with that volume, a good option is going to be a service where a truck can actually come to you and shred on site. The truck can come directly to the location in which shred curbside and will shred up to about nine file boxes. Anything less than 300 pounds is $150 for that service. Okay. Let me think about it and I'll give you a call back on FM. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
