 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi. Good afternoon, Ashley. I was hoping I'm trying to dispose of... I have a shark fin for my medication that is full and I'm trying to dispose of it accordingly. And I've been trying to find someone to help me out all day and I've just been hitting a wall in my area and so I was hoping to see... I found you guys and you're not far from me so I was hoping to see if you guys could help me out. Okay and this is a shark disposal that you have, correct? Yes, yes. Yeah, it's my... Yes. And what's your zip code? 94510. All right. 94510. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. Because, yeah, I'm at our corporate office here but I do list a couple of just sharp, drop-off locations and I can text you their direct information. That would be wonderful. They can let you know what they charge if there's room in there been, you know, just verify first and call them before you head in. And then what is your first name? My first name is Julie. Perfect, Julie. Why did you send you a couple of options over? Am I will send you one other text? It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review so if you get a moment for that as well that would be appreciated. Okay, wonderful. Thank you, Ashley. Appreciate your help. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
