 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Ashley, is this a force that I call you? It gives you a little bit of information about your shredding services. Yeah. How many boxes are bags of shredding do you have to meet you? There's probably one, it's kind of maybe two, my bankers boxes. Okay. So the couple of bankers boxes, as long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off is a good option for you. Yeah. What's your zip code? 33713. All right. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. So I can text you a couple of locations that you offer the drop off services. If you call them directly, they'll let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. So I want to send that over to you. And then what's your first name, sir? J, J-Y. Thanks, J. Well, I did text you a couple of options. I will send you one other text. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Cool. I also have another question before you go. Sure. So the paper work that I'm looking to have shredded, it was recovered from a, you know, those hurricane floods that we had last year. The paper has been dried and everything, but is there any stipulation on that? Do you guys, because of environmental factors or is there any... Is there any... Is there any... Yes, there are. I mean, you know, some people will find a bunch of mold on their paper that does cause an issue. But if it's dried out and not moldy, then it shouldn't be a problem. Okay, super. Okay, thank you very much, Pritchette. Thanks. Bye-bye. Have a good day.
