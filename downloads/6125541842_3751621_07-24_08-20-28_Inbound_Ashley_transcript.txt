 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. I live in Minneapolis. I'm willing to drive if I need to. It's not a problem. But I have about three grocery size sacks full of paper. I'd like to have shred. OK. And what is the zip code of where that's located? 5403. So what's that amount? As long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off is a great option for you. Those are going to be UPS stores, mail centers, things like that that offer drop off services. As long as you don't need to witness it, I can text you a couple locations nearby. I don't necessarily need to witness it, but I don't consider those places to be the safest to drop off documents that have an awful lot of personal information. So there are other options where a truck service can come to you and shred on site. If you did want to witness the shredding, that would be the only on-side option that we would have. Yeah, would you do that for just three bags? I mean, they can come up for usually any amount. Is that a residence? It's a condo. So I don't know that that wouldn't necessarily work because it's a densely populated area would be hard to find a parking place. OK. I'm assuming it's a big truck. OK, so yeah, it is a quite big truck, but it's not showing that there is a truck service for that area right now. Yeah. So the other option is going to be, yeah, so on the only other option I would have is the truck service. Or I'm sorry, is the drop off a part, right? OK, but you're saying it's at UPS stores. Correct. Yeah, the UPS stores offer the drop off, yes. Yeah. I may call you back, but thank you for your help. Thank you. Bye-bye.
