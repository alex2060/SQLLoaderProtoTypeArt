 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Sorry, the biggest punish. I don't speak Spanish, I'm sorry. Oh, I received one text for employment. Okay, we don't do any hiring. We're a call center out of this office, so you might have the wrong number. Sorry, my English is very good. I think you have the wrong number. I forget my URL. Oh, thank you. Thank you.
