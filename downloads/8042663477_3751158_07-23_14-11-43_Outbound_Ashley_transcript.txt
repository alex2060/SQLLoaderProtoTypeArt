 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley, I just have a really quick question. I'm going to bring you folks some paper, just paper stuff. Nothing, no electronics or anything, but is it necessary for me to make an appointment before bringing the things or can I just drop the stuff off? So it's just dependent on your volume. How many file boxes or files words of shredding do you have? Oh, maybe like two. Okay, so yeah, with a couple boxes or bags, as long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off can be a good option for you. What's your zip code and I can see what's nearby? Well, I'm looking at the map. I know exactly what's nearby. It's a couple miles from our house. It's on Staples Mill Road. So that's the only reason for my question. I didn't know if they needed an appointment or if I could show up with a small amount. I don't need an appointment, but I would always call first to make sure that there's room in there bin because those do fill up. So other than that, that's, yes, or I can transfer you there if you'd like to speak with them. Okay, can you do that? Yeah, hold on just a moment. Thank you. You're welcome.
