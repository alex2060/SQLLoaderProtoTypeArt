 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How are you going to help you? Hi Ashley. My name is Brittany Blancher and I work at the Assumption Art in the Polyviz Bill. And I have a couple of bales of shredded paper that I'm looking to get rid of and I was wondering what you guys do with your shredded paper and what I could do on a company that's also to or what. So with our shredded paper that we have, it's securely recycled. Okay. So what does that mean if I was going to try to? You say you already have shredded paper, is that correct? Yeah. And it's already bailed. I have like nine or ten bail. And unfortunately we just don't take already shredded paper, unfortunately. So do you guys sell it to a company? I know the shredders have facilities. We actually work with a network of shredders, so we don't deal with the paper directly at all. We just work with a bunch of different shredders nationwide. So each location is a little different. Got you. Okay. I'm trying to see. Would you be able to give me some contact or companies that I can maybe call to see if they would be willing to take some bail? Unfortunately I'm not able to give out their information like that. So I do apologize. Okay. I got it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
