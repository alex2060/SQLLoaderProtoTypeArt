 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hey, Ashley, how much do you charge to shred, I guess, personal documents, paper? Yeah, how many boxes or bags of shredding you estimate you have? I have two, like garbage bags. And what's the zip sort of where the shredding is located? It would be Frederick 2-1-774. 2-1-774. So in that area with that volume, one of your best options is looking into a drop-off location. Those are going to be UPS stores that offer that. You can pay by the pound to leave stuff with them. So if you are interested in that, see a couple of locations nearby. I think I have one of those locations not far from me. So I'll look into that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye-bye.
