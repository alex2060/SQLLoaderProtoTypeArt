 Thank you for calling Medical Waste Pro. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. I did a search online and it said that you accept use needles. Is there a fee for turning in use needles? We do list some different options here. What is your zip code and I can see what's nearby? 6268. 6268, okay. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. All right. So what I can do is, let's see. I do see a couple of sharp drop-off options. I'm going to text you a couple of locations. If you want to reach out to them directly, they can get you some information on how that works. Okay. So you have some options now. And then what is your first name? Renee. Thank you, Renee. Why did you go ahead and send those information right over to you? I will send another text. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Thanks, Ashley. Have a great day. Thanks. Thank you. Bye-bye.
