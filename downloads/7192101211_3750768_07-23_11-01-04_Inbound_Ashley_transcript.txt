 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. I had called earlier. I'm trying to get a price per pound on shredding at the Shine Mountain location, but when I was connected, it just went to a voicemail that said the voice back so small. Okay. So you're trying to reach the UPS store drop off? Is that correct? Is that what it is? Is it a UPS store? The UPS store is correct. Are the ones that accept the drop off services? So if this is a cell phone, I can text you a few direct phone numbers for them. That's okay. I mean, do you know what the price per pound is? The price per pound, they set their own pricing, so you do have to call them directly. Oh, okay. Okay. So it's not a Shred Nations location. It's a UPS. Okay. I think that's correct. Yep. I agree. Okay. Yeah. What is that number for that? I think it's 445. Is Shine Mountain Boulevard? Yeah. That number is 719-576-2880. Okay. Hopefully I'll get somebody. And what's there another one kind of in that vicinity? Okay. So if you just search the UPS store, that would be a good start, and then it will get you directly to you. Oh, okay. Okay, great. Thanks for your help. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
