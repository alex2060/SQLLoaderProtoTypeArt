 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley, I'm in a beddie. I work at a lab in Bozen, Montana, and we produce some biohazardous waste that was hoping to get a quote, and how you guys charge for pickups on that. Yeah, are you looking for a one-time need or an ongoing service? An ongoing service. Okay. Ideally like a scheduled pickup, like maybe every three weeks or monthly. Okay, and what is the zip code where you need the service? What's that? What's the zip code where you need the service? Five, nine, seven, one, five. All right, perfect. So yeah, let me gather a little information from you, and then I can have the shredder that does service the area or the medical waste provider for your area get in touch with you directly. What is your personal name? Edward Ooth. And Edward, how do I sell your last name? F-O-O-S. All right, and what is the name of the business that you're with? Nordic labs. Okay. And what is the best phone number to reach you with information? 406-321-4099. All right, is there a secondary phone number you'd like us to have? Not at the moment. Okay. And then what's a good email address for you? Eddie J. Fouce at gmail.com. And Eddie is EDVI. And that's jay is in john f-o-o-s at gmail.com. Yes ma'am. All right, perfect. So what I'm going to go ahead and do here is I'll get this information right over to the medical waste provider that does service the boson area. Okay. I'll contact you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well. It's going to have some info on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. In that email, there'll also be a small section that does ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. If you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Thank you. Use vote. Bye-bye.
