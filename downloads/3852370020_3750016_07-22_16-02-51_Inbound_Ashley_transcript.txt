 Thank you for calling Medical Ways Pro. This is Ashley. How could I help you? Yes, my name is Mary and I was helping my grandma do some cleaning and we found a bunch of old syringes. They haven't been used yet but we're not sure what to do with them. They're probably about 20 years old and the needles are still attached to them and everything. So we're not sure what to take on. Can we drop them off to you guys and you guys dispose of them or hence the slurks? Yes, not to where I am but we do list the locations that you can take into taking that to. What is the zip code? A zip code. 84120. 84120. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. Okay, so it looks like I can text you a couple locations that do offer some sharp strap-offs. If you want to reach out to them directly, they can get you some information on that. So I went ahead and sent that over to you, Mary. And then I will also send you one other text. It's just going to be asking how my customer service was today if you get a moment for that great. But those numbers should be right on there for the locations to call. Okay, you're the best. Thank you very much. You're very welcome. Bye-bye. You did, bye.
