 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, I was interested in having some a document shredded. Okay. How many boxes or bags of shredding do you estimate you have? Approximately six of garbage bags, like the standard kitchen size garbage bags. Six kitchen size bags. Okay. And what's the zip code that you're located in? Four, three, three, six. All right. Is this the cellphone that you're on? Because I can text you some drop-off locations that can accept smaller amounts. Yes. Okay. So as long as you don't need to witness this shredding, I'll send you a couple of UPS stores. If you call them directly, they'll be the ones that let you know what they charge. And if there's room in there, bin. So I want to send that over to you. And then what is your first name, sir? Ray. Ray. Perfect Ray. Why did you get that sent to you? I will send you another text. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a call for that as well, that would be appreciated. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
