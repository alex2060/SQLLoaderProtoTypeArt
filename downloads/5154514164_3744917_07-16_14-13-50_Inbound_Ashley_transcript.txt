 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, a gentleman just called me because I had contacted you guys earlier and I met her the name of the business and thought that I had contacted him in air and I want to apologize because we are interested in having you come because he was calling from this number. So I see that we got you in touch with our partner, the Shredder. So that would have been possibly who was trying to contact you with a quote. Let me give you their direct phone number. Oh, okay. So the phone number to reach the Shredder is 515-280-3013 Oh, huh. Yep, and if you call them directly they should be able to get you some information. Okay, that's great. 515-280-3013. Yep. Thanks a lot. Bye.
