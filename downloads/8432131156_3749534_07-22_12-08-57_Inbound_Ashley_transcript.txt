 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, I'm sorry. Somebody just called me back. And one thing I, a question I forgot to ask was, how about staples? Do you have to? For the truck service, staples and paper clips are okay to stay in there. So any soft, bendable metal by hand can stay. Just any hard chunky metals would have to be removed. But staples are okay. Yes. Oh, okay, that's just wanted to make sure about that. All right, thank you very much. Thank you.
