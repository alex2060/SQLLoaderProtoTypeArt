 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, I'm calling to get quotes on. I have some shredding that I guess I need to do in Bakersfield. I'm in Lancaster, but my company wants me to go up there, grab the documents, and call you guys and get a shredding company. They had offered somebody, but I can't remember who it was. Okay. What's the zip code of where the shredding is located? It's across from the jail on Chester. Let me get that address for you. I guess that would help. You're my first company, so I don't know what I'm doing yet. Sure. At least the zip code would be helpful. Thank you. Okay, Bakersfield. Oh, stop. Someone's texting me over and over. It's like, I'm busy. All right. Okay. Bakersfield bail bonds is where it is. Okay. Our building had burned out. It's on 1330, Chester Avenue, or no, 1401 K Street. Let me click on it and see if it'll give me the address. 9301. 9301, perfect. Okay. Do you know roughly how many file boxes or file drawers of shredding are there? I haven't gotten up there. Say there's three filing cabinets with four drawers full. Okay. And I'm sorry. How many filing cabinets that are three drawers? Our four drawers. Or five. However many, you know, a tall filing cabinet has. Say three. Three, four, maybe five drawer file cabinets. Are these the square vertical drawers or do you know if they're the wide lateral drawers? They're the ones that are upright for like, I don't know if they're legal or letter. They might be letter size. If you look at them from the front, would you envision them being just like the square drawers or are they the wider lateral drawers? They're the square ones. They're the inner filing cabinets, the document files. Okay. Perfect. So let me gather a little info from you. And then I'll have the shredder that does service the area. I get you some pricing and some information. What's your first and last thing? It's Lisa Bench. The ENCH. Yes. And what's the name of the business? It's absolute bail bonds or Baker's Fill bail bond. We go by either one. Or office burns. Oh no. But it's fine. Thank you. I was hoping everyone's okay. Well, no, it's the most people got in there and. Oh gee. That's not good. Okay. So yeah, we can at least try to help you with this part of it. What's the best phone number to reach you? It's 661-478-5891. All right. Is there a secondary phone over you'd like us to have? That should do it. That's the number I carry. Okay. And a good email address. I don't ever check my email. Do you need one? They do require an email. They just like to send them. So you don't have to respond that way. But it's Lisa at. D-A-A like California. And then bail. B-A-Bail.com. And that's C-A-A-L. I-L-A-L.com. Okay. That's C-A-L-A-L. Yes. Our own domain. All right. I'm going to get this right over to the shredder that does service the area. They'll contact you as soon as they get in moment with some information. And then I will send you an email with some additional info. I know you don't check it. But if you do happen to check it, they'll be some info in there. But we'll have them in touch. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
