One-time purge. And how many file boxes or file doors of Shredding do you estimate you have? 50. All right. That's 50 boxes. Perfect. So let me gather a little info from you and then I'm going to have the Shreddo that does service the area. I get you some pricing and information on this. What's your first and last name?

In the boxes you're referring to, are these the small 15-inch copy paper boxes or the larger two-foot-banker boxes? Uh-uh. Copy-like copy paper boxes. Smaller ones. Okay. Probably Lisa. So there's four shredders that do service the Buena Park area. So I'm going to have each of them in touch with you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well. It's going to have some info on who that is that we're giving you in touch with. In that email, there'll also just be a small section that does ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Thank you. You have a good day. Uh-uh. Bye. Bye-bye.
