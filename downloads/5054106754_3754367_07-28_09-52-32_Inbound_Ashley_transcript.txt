 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. It's Geraldine. How are you today? So well, how are you? Blessed. Ashley, I was kind of asked for a quote for a small spreading job. I have about, I would guess, six to seven paper boxes of papers that need to be spreaded. Okay. I'm trying to see what you provide, what services you provide, and what they cost. Sure. So with that amount, it would be a service where a truck comes to you for the shredding. What's your zip code? 8709. All right. And is this at a business, resident storage? It's a resident. It's a home resident. Okay. Yeah, so it looks like in that area, there is a truck service that can come to your location. It would shred right there on site while you watch. For anything under 300 pounds or about nine file boxes worth of shredding, it's $170 for that service. Okay. Do you have a facility where I could go to where the fee might be less than that? Unfortunately, no. The walk-in locations are going to be UPS store-than-male centers that charge by the pound. And they would, you'd actually need to pay more over time trying to pay, you know, you probably have at least a couple hundred pounds. So you didn't pay, even at a dollar a pound, you'd pay more over time that way. Right. Right. Well, thank you for this quote this morning. I appreciate it. You're welcome. Have a good day. You're too much less than we would buy now. Thank you. Bye-bye.
