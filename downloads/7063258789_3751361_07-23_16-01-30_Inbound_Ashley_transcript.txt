 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yeah, I'm just going to see how much it costs to have paper shredded. Yeah, so there's a few options offered based on your volume. How many boxes or bags of shredding do you estimate you have in total? Hi. Oh, I don't know. Like, you're rude. When you say boxes, what size box are you using? We're referring to a small 10 by 12 by 15 inch box. Okay. Yes. Maybe five or so. Six. Five or six? Yeah, it's my mom. I'm playing her house. It's just a bit of a short. The hoarder. And he has kept everything on his favorite if he's ever been touched. I've got most of it. Most of it. But I have one bedroom left. And it's kind of like I've got it where it's kind of covered so before. So I sure. I just can't do it anymore. I've been using this little personal shredder and it just takes forever. Right, right. Okay. So yeah, what I can do is have this shredder. Or let me see here. I can, I wonder if I've got the pricing out of this office for the area. What's the zip code? 319-09. 319-09. Okay. So there is a truck service that can actually come to you for the shredding. If it's anything more than a few small boxes where the shredding the best option is a truck service that can come to you. So what I'll go ahead and do is I'll get this information right over to. I can gather some info from you and then have the shredder contact you directly with some information. What is your first and last name? It's Kristen Clark. If it's too expensive, we won't be able to do it. I'll just have to do it. There's too much in the half the data. Do you know like a range price of what it would possibly be? You know, I know industry average is, I've seen it anywhere from $100 to $200. The truck can come and shred curbside. It's anywhere from $100 to $200 for possibly. $100 to $200. $100 to $200. Shredding. Okay, no, I can't do it. I'm sorry. Okay, no problem. I appreciate your time. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye.
