 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Ashley, I'm Margaret. I'm trying to find out if you guys serve us Oxford Georgia. Oh, yeah. What's the zip code there? I can look into some options. 30054. All right. 80054. And is this at a business or residence? Residence. All right. How many file boxes or file doors do you estimate you have in total? They're not in boxes. I mean, they're in boxes at measure 16 by 12 by 12. And it's about 20 of them. OK. Perfect. So let me gather a little info from you and then I'm going to have the shredder that does service the area contact you directly with some pricing and information. What's your first time lasting? Margaret Warfield. Now, how do I spell the last name? W-A-R-S-I-E-L-D. All right. And what is the best phone number to reach you with information? 770-364-9021. All right. Is there a secondary number you'd like us to have? No. And a good email. W-A-R-S-I-E-L, the number 2 at bellsoft.net. All right. Perfect. So what I'll go ahead and do here is I'm going to get this information right over to the three shredders that do service that area there in Oxford. They will contact you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well. It's going to have some info on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. In that email, there will also be a small section that does ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one click, one to five star review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. OK. All right. Thanks so much. You have a good day. All right. You too. Bye-bye. Sorry.
