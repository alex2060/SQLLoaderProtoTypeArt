 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Oh, hi. I have some shredding that I wanted done. It's not very much. I can't really describe how much, but I mean it's like a black trash bag, maybe half-full or something or other. I was wondering, I know you're in the UPS store in Escondito. That's right. So I'm at our corporate office, but those UPS stores are drop-off locations for small amount of shredding. Okay. So if you don't need to witness the shredding, drop-off can be a great option for you. What's your... Okay. 92082. I'm in Valley Center right next to Escondito. Okay. And is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. All right. I'm going to go ahead and text you a couple locations that offer the drop-off services. If you want to reach out to them directly, they'll let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. So I'll go ahead and send that over to you. And then what is your first name? Teresa. All right. You're perfect. So I just text that over to you Teresa. I will send you one other text. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's... Okay. One quick review. If you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. I mean, I will call those locations and look at your details on how those drop-offs work. All right. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thank you.
