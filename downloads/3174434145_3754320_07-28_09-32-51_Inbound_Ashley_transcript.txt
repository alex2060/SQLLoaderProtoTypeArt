 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. Can you tell me, do you have on-site paper shredding? We do have some on-site shredding options. What's your zip code? 7-7-4-9-3. And you're looking for some on-site shredding? Yes. Just for a small amount. I have two small, like one small waste basket and one small, like a rubber-made tight container with a lid. Okay. So this would be a truck service that comes to you, is it at a business or residence? It's at a residence. So, do you have the trucks like anywhere else where I could go to it? So no, unfortunately, there's no walk-in location or drop-off that doesn't use on-site in front of you. The only on-site option is the truck that comes to you. Yeah. I'm not sure that I want to do that. It's a very small amount. What is the cost for that? So, for the truck service that comes to you in shred on-site, it'll shred anything up to 300 pounds, which is about nine file boxes. It's $159 to shred on-site. Yeah. I only have two small boxes. So that's not going to work for me. Do you know of anything, any place in town that does on-site shredding for a small amount of papers? No, ma'am. I don't have a walk-in or anything like that. It's just the truck service, unfortunately. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
