 Hi, I'm sorry. Can you hear me at all? I can hear you, yes. Can you hear me? Yeah, it's a little spotty. I was just curious. I sold a veterinarian practice three years ago and still well-canned. And I can legally start shredding all the medical papers as a joy one of this year. How about doing that? Is that a service where I would bring the stuff to you guys? Or do you come by the house? Because it's all at my house right now. Do you come by the house and shred it? So it depends on your volume. What is your zip code? 66212. 66212, okay. And how many file boxes or files were the shredding? Would you estimate that you have? Well, when I think about filing drawers, there's probably eight, but they're really long. So I don't know if that would be considered ten. Okay, so these are eight, like two-foot-long file boxes. These are probably three-foot-wide files, three-foot-wide, probably two-foot-deep. Okay. We're talking 20 years of paperwork. Okay, and these are like larger bins, correct? Yeah. They're old filing cabinets, but they're big, big filing cabinets. Oh, I'm sorry. So these are drawers. Is that every time I get to eat drawers? Yeah. Yep. So eight of the long lateral drawers. Perfect. Okay, that's a good example. We're looking at it. So yeah, that amount, the best option is a service where a truck comes to you. Let me gather some information from you, and then I can have the shredder that services the area, get you some pricing and information. What's your first lesson? It's Jennifer. Last name, skybers, SKI, VSN, Victor, ERS. All right, and that's phone number to reach you. 113-9-6-3-6-8-5-6. All right. Is there a secondary phone number you'd like us to have? No, that's the best. Okay. And a good email address. Jenny J. E. M. N. Y. S. K. I. G. E. R. S. at gmail.com. Let me make sure I have everything spelled correctly. I'm going to have a good email address. I'm going to have a good email address. Jenny J. E. N. Y. Last name, SKI is an Indigo. Is that VSN, Victor, or Zia Zanzibra? Okay. S. K. I. VSN, Victor, ERS at gmail.com. Yes. Perfect. So what I'll do here, there are two shredders that do service the Overland Park area. I'm going to have each of them in touch with you directly with some pricing and some information. I'm going to have that email. There'll also just be a small section that does ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Awesome. All right. Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
