 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, can you tell me about pricing please? Sure. So there's a couple options based on your volume. Do you know how many file boxes or file drawers are shredding? You might have in total. I probably have 20 to 30 file boxes. Yeah, so with that amount the best option is a service where truck comes to your location for the shredding. What's your zip code? 46375. All right, and is this out of business, storage facility, residence? Residents. Okay, so yeah, let me gather a little information from you here and then I can have the shredder that does service the area, get you some pricing and information on this. What's your first and last name? First name is Helen. Last name is Capis, C-A-P-P-A-S. All right, Capis, C-A-P-P-A-N. And what's the best phone number to reach you? 219-308-4774. All right, is there a secondary number you'd like us to have? No, that's it. Okay, and a good email. H-Capis H-C-A-P-P-A-S-7-6 at gmail.com. All right, so what I'll go ahead and do here is I'm going to get this info right over to the shredder that does service the area. They'll contact you directly with pricing and information. And then I will also send you an email with some additional information in there, Helen. In that email, there'll also be a small section that does ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review, so if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. All right, thank you. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Bye.
