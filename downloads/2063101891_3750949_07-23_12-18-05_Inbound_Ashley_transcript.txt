 Thank you for calling Shrednation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. I have about 700 pounds of documents to be shredded and I was wondering if you have a facility in the Maple Valley area that could handle that. Okay. What says the code of where that's located? Well, it's in Maple Valley on the glory gun. It's all in a trailer. So what I'd like to do is just drop it off at wherever the facility is. Unfortunately, the only drop off locations we list to handle about three small boxes or less. If it's anything more than that, then it's going to be a service where the truck comes to you. Okay. And what is the cost of getting that truck to come to me? What's your zip code you said 90-038? Yes. Okay. Is this at a residence or a business? It's at a residential area, but it's a vacant lot that I have fans that I would go out and do for a meet-up. Okay. Yeah. So with that, there is a couple options for a truck service to come to the Maple Valley area. Let me gather a little info and then we'll get you some pricing and information. What's your first and last name? John. Ben Buster, P.S. Invicta, A.N. B.S. and Bob. U.S. K.I.R.K. Okay. And what is the best phone number to reach you with information? 206-310-1891. All right. Is there a secondary number you'd like us to have? No, that's it. Okay. And a good email address for you. John, J.O.H.N.. Ben Buster, P.S. and Bob. U.S. K.I.R.K. The number two at gmail.com. All right. And let me make sure I have this correct. I have John J.O.H.N. B.S. and Bob. V.A.N. B.S. and Bob. U.S. K.I.R.K. Two at gmail.com. That's correct. Perfect. John. So what I'm going to go ahead and do here is I'll get this information right over to the two shredders that do service the area. I'm going to have each of them in touch with you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well with some info on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. Okay. And then I will send you an email. There will be a small section that does ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one click review. If you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks, John. Have a good day. Bye. Bye.
