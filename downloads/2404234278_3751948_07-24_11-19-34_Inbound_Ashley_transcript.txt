 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, my name is Sylvia Wilson. I have two boxes with personal information that need to be shredded. Okay. I wanted to know the quote for it. Yeah. How many file boxes or file doors are shredding? Do you estimate you have in total? Two. Okay. It's just that I'm not personal. So I need to shred it. Okay. With that amount of drop-off is a great option for you. What's your zip code and I can see what's nearby? Okay. All right. What is your zip code? 20772. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. Uh-huh. Okay. So what I can do is text you a couple of locations, their UPS stores that offer the drop-off services. If you want to reach out to them directly, they will let you know what they charge and if there's room in their van, okay? Okay. Can I ask you a question? Yes. Can you send it to my Gmail? Well, so it'll text you. So I just have the tape of capabilities to text, but I think you should be able to. Oh, okay. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. Yes, I'll send it over to you. Thank you. Bye.
