 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? How much Ashley, how are you? Doing well. How are you? Doing well. I have a question of how much does it cost to get a foreshredded by your company? So it depends on which route you go or how much you have. How many boxes are bagged you estimate you have in total? I don't know yet. I'm going through a storage unit. OK. So if it ends up being just a few file boxes or less and you don't need to witness the shredding, you would look into dropping off at like a UPS store or mail center, something like that. If it's anything more than a few file boxes, and that would be a service where the truck comes to the location. So we would need at least a rough estimate of what you think you may have to get the truck started on getting a quote or you can always follow the instructions. OK, well. Thank you so much. Gotcha. I thought this show that you guys are down the street for order ads. I thought this was a brick and mortar field and I do apologize. OK. No, yet that location is most likely the UPS store that offers the drop off services. So if you wanted to reach out to them, the UPS store would get you info on what they charge for pound, but that's only if you've got this small amount. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye.
