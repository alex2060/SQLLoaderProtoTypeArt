 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes, hi. Good morning. First of all, are you located on 5920 Gwai in the little last trip mall? I'm at our corporate office. That is actually a drop off UPS store. How many boxes or bags of shredding do you estimate that you have? Just a like a diaper box, not even halfway. Something really small, not much. Okay, so a small amount of shredding you can look into dropping off. Let me transfer you to the UPS store and then they'll get you some information on this, okay? The one on Gwai, right? Yes. Yes, perfect. Thank you.
