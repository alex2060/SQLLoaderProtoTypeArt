 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. Is it actually how can I help you? Ashley, I'm acquiring about the cost of your service. What is the minimum charge for? Yeah, so there's a couple of options. There's just a couple boxes. Okay, so with a couple boxes we would refer you to a drop-off location. Those are UPS stores, mail centers, things like those lines. Right. What's the zip code? I know where the UPS store is. 8505 or 7. Okay, if you call the drop-off location directly, there'll be the ones to let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. That's where I would start with your amount. You don't know what the minimum, the $45 or something. I don't have some more of something. No, I don't have their pricing per pound. They set their own pricing so you will want to call them directly. All right, thank you. Bye. Thank you.
