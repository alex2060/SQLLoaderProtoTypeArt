 Thank you for calling Shrednation. This is Joshua. Hi. Yes. I'm interested in spreading a member role. I'm just curious about the method and the cost and that kind of a thing. Sure. What's the zip code of where the shredding is located? Great question. Okay. Lori, what's the zip code again? 53593. 53593. Okay. Is this shredding at a business, at a residence, a storage? I was hoping to drop it off. Okay. If it's three file boxes or less, drop off is a great option. Is that what you have? We have more than that, but we were still hoping to drop it off. Okay. We're trying to clear out a house. Yeah. Let me just see if I have someone else I know of. Unfortunately, the only drop-offs I'm aware of in the area are going to be UPS stores. The next best option is going to be a truck service that comes to you by appointment. That's for the larger amount. Okay. I'll give someone else a call. Thank you.
