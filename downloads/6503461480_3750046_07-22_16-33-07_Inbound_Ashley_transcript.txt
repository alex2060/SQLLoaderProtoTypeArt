 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. This is Pessie Mann. I call this morning to be hopefully much chocolate and other shredding company to come over this week to my house. And I haven't heard back yet. Let's see. So I know that you have a certain timeframe. I believe Kaylee was still waiting to hear back from the shredder. We just haven't heard back yet. So let me just verify. Are you referring to? Because the shredder was assigned to already. I called them. I was told it told me they cannot come to next week. That must have been with another company because I'm yeah, it looks like we're we're waiting to hear if we can find a match for you, but it's not looking like we have anything as a right now. But as soon as we do have some information for you will let you know. Okay. So can you expedite that and just call them now. Do you have anything to wait for them to call you back? Yeah. I mean, so it looks like we have followed up with them. We're just now it looks like we gave them a call just about an hour ago. So we do have these follow ups, but it's just showing that we haven't gotten an answer on that yet. So we do just have to wait till we hear something. Okay. And which company are you referring to? Which one you wait for? I don't know. But I think it's a little bit more than the area unfortunately I can't give you their info, but as soon as we do have some info for you will let you know. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye bye.
