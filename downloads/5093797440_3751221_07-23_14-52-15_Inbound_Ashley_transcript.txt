Yeah, there are services where the truck would come to you. How many file boxes or file boards do you estimate you have? Just a rough estimate about anywhere from 45 to 60 boxes. Okay. And are these the small 15-inch boxes or the larger 2-foot ones, would you say? I would say there's about 42-foot ones and about anywhere from 15 to 20 smaller ones. Okay. Okay. Perfect. So yeah, let me gather a little information from you. And then I'm going to have the shredder that does service the area. I get you some pricing and information on this.

I'm going to have each of them in touch with you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well. It's going to have some info on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. In that email, there will also just be a small section that does ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
