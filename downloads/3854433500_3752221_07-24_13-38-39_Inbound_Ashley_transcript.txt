 Thank you for calling Record Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hey Ashley, I work for a company based in Utah and I've got a bunch of old construction blueprints and stuff that I'm looking to digitize. I've kind of found that you guys are who to talk to to get in touch with the right people. Sure. Yeah, I can try to get you some information on this. How many pages do you estimate you have in total? I would say hundreds. Okay. Are we talking like 100 plus or? I'd say between 250 and 500. Okay. All right. So yeah, let me gather some information and I can try to get you in touch with a partner of mine. It can handle some large format scanning. What's your zip code? 84123. All right. And so unfortunately that's not meeting a minimum in that area because we do very high volume scanning. But what I can try to do is refer you to someone that might be able to help you. Okay. I'll work with a company called AMT Printing. And I can give you their number. Yeah, that'd be great. All right. Your number is 801-468-1919. 1919. Perfect. Okay. And you said that was AMT Printing. Correct. Okay. Perfect. I will reach out to them. I appreciate your time. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye.
