 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. That's a Vashley. How can I help you? Hi. I'm trying to want to stretch on paper. You know, how much do you charge per box? Yeah. So how many file boxes do you have in total? Because there's different options for different amounts. From at least five. Okay. What's the zip code over that's located? It's ok one. Now for six to one. 94621 you said? Yes. All right. Is this at a residence business storage business? Okay. Yeah. So with that amount, it would be a service where the truck comes to the location for the shredding. Let me see here. It looks like the trucking comes to the location. It would shred their curbside. For anything up to about nine file boxes worth of shredding or anything under 300 pounds. It's $170 for that service. For the truck. How about for the shredding? Know that that shreds up to 300 pounds. Okay. 170. Hello. I'm sorry. Yep. 170 correct. Total. Is that a total? So that is the total 170 to shred up to 300 pounds or maybe taxes or something that's not included. And it will come to my location. Correct. Okay. Is it sender? Yes. I have to make my appointment. Scheduled by appointment. So as soon as you decided something you want to move forward with, you let us know. And then we would get you to the scheduler to discuss availability. Okay. All right. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
