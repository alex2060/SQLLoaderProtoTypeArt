 Thank you for calling Shreddins. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Good morning, Ashley. My name is Teresa. And I found you guys just online. And I have two blocks of paper documents that need shredded. The box is a paper box. I can buy a piece of paper. Yeah. So with that amount, drop off is a great option for small amounts of shredding. What's your zip code and I can see with nearby? Well, I'm 74342, but I'm in prior right now, and can come by. Well, I'm at our corporate office, but I can get you in touch with a drop off nearby. So are you looking at that location and Claremore? Yes, I am. Yes. Okay, so I can transfer you to that location. If you want to, that's a UPS store. They'll be the ones to let you know what they charge for pound if there's room in there bin and all that, okay? That's great. Yes, please check your house. All right. You're welcome.
