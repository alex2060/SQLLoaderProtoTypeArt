 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hey, I'm wondering do you take any used needles or injection shops? We do have some different options when it comes to that. What's your zip code? 95051. Okay. And is this for a business or is this personal? Personal. Okay. And you're looking for some sharp disposal? Yeah. I'm also right next to the East-Powell Automatic Waste Pros location. Does this location take any sharp? So I'm actually, so that location you might be looking at is a pharmacy. You'd have to reach out to them directly to see if they handle the sharps. But if this is a cell phone, I can text you a couple options of some sharps disposal that I know of that you can call. Could you just text me a few options you have? Can you text me on the address near 95051? Yep, 95051. I did just text you a few options. If you'd like to call those locations directly, they should be able to get you some information. Okay. Okay. But not this pharmacy side is what you said, right? I believe the pharmacy only takes pharmaceuticals. You can always call them, but I texted you some locations that I know take sharps, but you'll have to just call and verify that as well. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much. I thank you.
