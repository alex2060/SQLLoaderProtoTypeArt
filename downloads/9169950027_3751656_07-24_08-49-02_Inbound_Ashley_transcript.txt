 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, yes. I've not used your company before. So I was wondering, what does it cost to bring a box of things that need to be shredded? Yeah. So there's a few options that are offered based on your volume. How many file boxes or file drawers are shredding you estimate you have in total? I think probably just one. Just I'm not a business. Okay. So as long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off is a great option for you. What's your zip code and I can see what's nearby? 22901. I think it's the one that's Seminole Trail. Okay. And is this a cell phone that you're on because I can actually text you some direct phone numbers to those drop off nearby? No. What do you mean? You're not on a cell phone? I am on a cell phone. But what are you going to send me? I can text you the telephone numbers for the drop off locations. Oh, okay. Perfect. Okay. All right. So I'll send that over to you. If you want to reach out to them directly, they should let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. I'm sorry. I would try them direct. Sorry. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
