 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, Ashley. I am looking. I have about 120 large banker boxes full of documents that need to be shredded. Do you offer mobile shredding? Yeah, we can definitely look into coming to you for that. What's the zip code of where it's located? 46324. Is this a business, storage, residence? It's a residence. Do you set 120 of the large two-foot long file boxes? I think there are two full, I mean the big ones. Not the smaller ones but the big ones. They're probably two feet. Great. Let me gather a little info. I'm going to have the shredder that does service the Hammond area, get you some pricing and information. What's your first and last name? My name is Kristen, K-R-I-S-T-E-N. Last name is Hill, H-I-L-L. All right, and the best phone number to reach you? 297761559. All right, is there a secondary number you'd like us to have? No, that's the best one that's myself. All righty, and then what's a good email address for you? There really isn't one but I'll give you K-T-E-N-H-A-M at AOL.com. K-S and K-S and Tom, E is an Edward and is a Nancy Hamm at AOL.com? Yes. Wonderful. Well, I will give this right over. So, the best phone number is the best phone number. The best phone number is the best phone number. So, what else do you want me to get this information right over to the shredder that does service the area? So, contact you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well. I know you don't check it off in, but just in case you need to refer to that, it'll have some information and the phone number for who's going to be in touch with you. So, if you have any questions or questions you want to ask, please go to the service was today. I can also text you this link, but it's just a quick one click, one to five star review. So, if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay, thank you, Ashley. Thank you. Have a great day, Kristen. Bye-bye.
