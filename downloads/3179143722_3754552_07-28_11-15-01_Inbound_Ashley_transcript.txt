 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Yes. How much do you charge for shredding? Is it per pound or? So the drop off locations are the ones that charge right a pound. How many boxes or bags of shredding do you estimate you have? Just one bag. OK. So with one bag, as long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off is a good option. What's your zip code? 466. 46143. OK. 46143. OK. Yeah. So what I can do is text you a couple of locations. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. All right. I'm going to text you a couple of options. If you call them directly, they'll be the ones to let you know what they charge in a thiz room. And they're been. So go ahead and text that over to you. And then I will send you another text as well. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. So if you get a moment for that, that'd be great. So call those locations and they'll get just in details. OK. OK. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Bye-bye.
