 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi, it's me. How are you? How are you regarding your shredding services? What's your rate for shredding services? Yeah, there's a few options that are offered based on your volume. How many file boxes or file doors of shredding would you have for me? Oh, not a whole lot. I'm saying between 50 and 75 pounds. Okay. So with smaller amounts of shredding, as long as you don't need to witness the shredding, drop off is a great option for you. What's your zip code and I look into some options nearby? 5-0-014. 5-0-014, okay. And is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes. All right. I can text you a couple of locations that offer the drop off services. If you want to reach out to them directly, they'll let you know what they charge and if there's room in there been. So I did just text you a couple of options if you want to call around, okay? Okay. The other thing is I heard that you do recycle all the electronics. We have some options when it comes to electronic recycling as well. What types of electronics do you have? Well, I have some printers and various accessories. I don't really have one computer, I think. Okay. So yeah, with small handheld electronics or things like that, I don't know if they'll handle printers. Usually it's hard drive cell phones, laptops, tablets. We do, they're in urban Dale. There's an electronics partner that we work with. I can text you their information as well. You can call them and see what they charge, what they accept, and all of that. Okay. Sounds great. All right. And what is your first name, sir? Joe. Perfect, Joe. Well, I did go ahead and text you a few options if you want to call around. I will send one other text as well. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-for-review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Thanks for your help. Thanks, Joe. You have a good day. Bye. Bye.
