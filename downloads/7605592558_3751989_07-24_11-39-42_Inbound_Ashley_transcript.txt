 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? I was going to set up an appointment to have you come to our office and shred a bunch of boxes. Okay. What's the zip code of where the shredding is located? 9295. All right. 9295. And is the shredding at a residence, a business, storage, business? Okay. And how many file boxes or file drawers do you estimate you have? I think somewhere about 60 to 70, something like that. Okay. Are these the small 15-inch copy paper boxes or the larger two-foot boxes would you say? Some of them are like the legal size, you know, 8x14 or whatever it is. The same are just regular 8x10s. Okay. So a couple of them, but they're both pretty small and size. All right. So let me gather a little information from you here. I'm going to have the shredder that does service the area, get you some pricing and some information on this. What is your first and last name? Carrie Watson. Carrie, I have some prizes. I shopped yesterday. I think this one. What about us in 50 cents? Oh, okay. Oh, you already, okay. I do see information here. So it looks like we did get your information right over here. Right over to our partners looks like South Lens shredding. So if that's who you're trying to reach, I can give you their phone number. Well, I don't know. It was two or three.
