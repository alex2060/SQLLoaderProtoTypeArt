 Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Ashley. How can I help you? I just needed to get a couple of boxes of document shredded. The L.D. wants, um, where I bring it to you. Um, so there are drop-off locations that we list. How many boxes or bags do you have in total? I just pour probably about 30 pounds. 30 pounds in total? 30 pounds, yeah. Okay. So yeah, with anything less than 90 pounds in total drop-off can be a good option for you. What's your zip code and I can see what's nearby? 76028. All right. And is this a cell phone that you're on because I can text you a couple of locations? Yes. I saw one on cell three ways. The number I pulled up just south before it worked. The 24th, and Barleson. Um, so I texted you a couple of locations that with their direct phone numbers and I believe the one. I believe it's 1169 North, Barleson Boulevard. So, um, yeah, if you want to call them directly, yet they, that I have their direct phone number on there for you. So they should be able to get you to an iPhone. And then I will send you another text that'll just ask how my customer service was today. If you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Thanks. Bye.
