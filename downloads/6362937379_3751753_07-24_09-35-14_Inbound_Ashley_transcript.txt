 Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Ashley. How can I help you? Hi Ashley. I wanted to get a quote and perhaps service on shredding about 20 file boxes. Right. Well, there's like 16 now, but I'm sure I can come up with another four. Okay, about 20 you're thinking, perfect. And what's the zip code of red that's located? 63121. All right. Is this had a business, residence, storage? It's a business. Okay. Yeah, let me gather some information from you. And then I'll have the shredder that does service the area, get you some pricing and information. What's your first and last name? It's Trisha. Last name is Sen. S-E-N-N. Thank you. And the business name? Below Medical Spa. Is that B-E-L-L-O? Yes. All right. And what is the best phone number to reach you with information? 6362937379. All right. Is there a secondary phone number you'd like us to have? No. All right. And a good email address. Trisha T-R-I-C-I-A-A-A-T-Bello-Med-Spa.com. All right. Got it. Trisha. Show what I'll go ahead and do here is I'm going to get this information right over to the two shredders that do service St. Louis. Each of them are going to contact you directly with some pricing and some information. And then I will send you an email as well. It's going to have some info on who that is that we're getting you in touch with. In that email as well, there'll be a small section that also asks how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Have a good day. Bye-bye.
