 Thank you for talking with us. Ashley, how can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for to take my medical, the shark containers. Okay. Is that all for a business? No, it's personal for myself. What's your zip code? It's 8-5256. All righty. And is this just a one-time need or is this an ongoing service? It'll be an ongoing design. I get three different shots. Okay. So if this is a cell phone, I can text you a couple options for sharp strap-offs. If you want to reach out to them directly, they can get you some information. Okay. All right. So go ahead and text you a couple options. Call those locations. They'll get you details on how the sharp strap-off works. And then what is your first name? Sylvia. Perfect Sylvia. Why did you get that sent right over to you? I will send you another text. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's like once, once, like review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
