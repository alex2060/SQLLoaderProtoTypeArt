 Thank you for your question. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. I just wanted to know if you have a location in Quincy, Illinois? Yeah. So there's a few options that are offered based on your volume. But there are services for drop-off as well. How many boxes or bags are just writing the US teammates that you have? It's like one 13 ounce garbage bag, if even that. All right. So with a small amount of shredding, one of the best options is going to be a drop-off service. And it looks like what's your zip code and I can actually see what's nearby? Sure. That would be great. 63459. Perfect. Is this a cell phone that you're on? Yes it is. Okay. So I can actually text you a location nearby. It's going to have their address and phone number. If you reach out to them directly, they will let you know what they charge, if there's room in their bin, all of that. And what is your first name, ma'am? Julie. Julie, perfect. All right, Julie, I'll get that over to you. I will send you one other text. It's just going to ask how my customer service was today. It's a quick one-click, one-to-five-star review. So if you get a moment for that as well, that would be appreciated. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good day. Bye-bye.
